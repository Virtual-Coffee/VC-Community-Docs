# Steps for creating YouTube videos

- Upload raw footage to YouTube
- Trim raw footage from beginning/end using YouTube Studio's editing UI
- Select the newly uploaded video to complete the "Video details" fields.
  - Title
  - Description --> this includes the talk description followed by the speaker bio
  - Thumbnail --> uploads the intro card file, or chooses an appropriate frame from the video
  - Sets the video privacy as appropriate
  - Adds video to the appropriate playlist(s)
  - Adds keyword tags
  - Sets "Languages, subtitles, and closed captions (CC)" as:
    - Video language: English (United States)
    - Caption certification: This content has never aired on television in the U.S.
    - Title and description language: English
  - Sets recording date --> leave location blank
  - Use "Standard YouTube License"
  - Sets "Comments and ratings" as:
    - Comment visibility: Hold potentially inappropriate comments for review
    - Sort by: Top
    - :heavy_check_mark: Show how many viewers like and dislike this video
- Select the "Subtitles" tab to add the video subtitles:
  - English should already be listed as a language. Click the "DUPLICATE AND EDIT" link in the rightmost column. Accept the warning that your current subtitles will be overwritten.
  - You'll see a pop-up window with default subtitles generated by YouTube. Click the "ASSIGN TIMINGS" button. This breaks the text into pieces that will display on the screen over certain time spans.
  - Go through the text to correct spelling and add punctuation (click "EDIT AS TEXT" to switch back to the large block of text if that's easier), then watch through the video with the edited captions to make sure they're displaying across the screen at the correct timings.
- Notes time points in the talk where there are natural breaks/transitions between topics so they can be noted in the video description and turned into chapters for easy viewer access.
- Adds a link to the video in the main GitHub issue for the brownbag talk
