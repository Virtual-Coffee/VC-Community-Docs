# Streaming zoom to youtube live

There are two ways to do this: scheduling a stream ahead of time, or starting a stream instantly during a meeting.

Note - although some Contributors have access to the youtube channel, only the Zoom host is able to start streaming from a zoom meeting.

Note - these instructions copied from [this link](https://it.umn.edu/services-technologies/how-tos/zoom-live-stream-youtube-or-custom), which has lots of screenshots and stuff too.

## Scheduled stream:

### Setting up the stream:

- Go to our [youtube streaming management page](https://studio.youtube.com/channel/UCc0579aGEy7jTAgRglR4J0g/livestreaming/manage) and choose "schedule stream" to create the scheduled stream
- After the stream is created, leave the tab open and in a new tab go to the meeting in zoom and scroll to the bottom of the page to the Live Streaming section
- Choose "configure live stream settings"
- There will be three fields to fill out: `Stream Key`, `Stream URL`, and `Live streaming page URL`
- `Stream Key` and `Stream URL` can be found on the settings page for the stream, and the `Live streaming page URL` can be found by clicking on the "share" icon (actually just an arrow) near the top of the page

### To start the stream:

- Start the Zoom call
- Select the `More...` button on the Zoom meeting control toolbar
- Choose `Live on Custom Live Streaming Service` (**_not_ `Live on YouTube`**).
- This does **not** start the stream yet.
- On the stream page on youtube, click the Go Live button on the upper right.
