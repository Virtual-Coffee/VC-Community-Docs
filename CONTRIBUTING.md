## Onboarding

Fork this repository and clone it down to your local machine.

## Test Coverage

Before you submit your pull request, run `npm run lint` to make sure your files adhere to the linter specs. We're using all default settings for Prettier, which relies on the [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/) specification for markdown files.

<!-- TODO: Work on adding a GitHub Action to PRs that runs the linter as well. -->
