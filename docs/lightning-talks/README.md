Welcome to the Lightning Talks docs!

## Coordinators

Check out [the project board](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/VC-Community-Docs/projects/1) for available tasks. Anything that isn't assigned is up for grabs.

We also have [a project board available](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/VC-Community-Docs/projects/2) for tracking individual talks. If you're assigned one of the "coordinate with speakers" issues, you'll use these cards to collect data and track progress.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask in the slack channel or in the [Lightning Talk Team](https://github.com/orgs/Virtual-Coffee/teams/lightning-talk-team) discussion board.
