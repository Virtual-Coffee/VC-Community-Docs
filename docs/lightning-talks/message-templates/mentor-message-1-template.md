Thank you all so much for volunteering to be mentors! We have created a couple of channels for clearer and more direct communication:

- `#lightning-talk-mentors` channel – Feel free to use this space to talk openly about mentoring or ask any questions you might have in order to best support the speaker(s) you're paired with
- `#lightning-talks` channel – Think of this as an open conversation room for you to support and cheer each other on, talk about the things you're excited about, ask for a second set of eyes, and to find larger group support

Since each speaker will have individualized needs, please ask them what type of support they are hoping for. Some suggestions are idea and organization brainstorming, slide review – if they have slides – talk rehearsal, and pacing.

Sometimes the hardest part is estimating time, so we encourage you to talk about this.

Lastly, check out the Mentor Guide located in this channel's canvas. You can access it by clicking on the button in the top right corner that looks like a note with a plus sign.

If you have any questions, please reach out. And thank you so much for supporting our speakers and the Virtual Coffee community!
