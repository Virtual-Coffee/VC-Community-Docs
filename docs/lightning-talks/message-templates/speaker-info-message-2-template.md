Hey {{ speaker name }}!

This is a friendly reminder to send me the following items as soon as possible:

- Talk title
- Talk description
- Headshot
- Speaker bio
- Optional links:
  - Social media (Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, etc.)
  - LinkedIn
  - Blog
  - Website
  - Streaming platform

You can send this info via Slack or email at {{ email address }}. The sooner you remit this info, the sooner we can create a graphic for you to use to promote your Lightning Talk on social media and in your network! Additionally, I will follow up in a few days to ask for the following:

- Length of talk (in minutes)
- Video recording of talk (if you are not presenting live)
- Talk slides (You can send updated slides directly to @Meg after this date if necessary)

However, you can send this info to me as well if you have it ready now. As always, please let me or @Meg know if you have any questions or comments.
