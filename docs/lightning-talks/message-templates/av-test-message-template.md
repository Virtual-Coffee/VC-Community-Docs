Hey speakers!

There are three more days until VC Lightning Talks and we usually conduct a technical test with the speakers in the days leading up to the event -- just to be sure everyone will see/hear you clearly on Friday! You will be doing your AV test with Dan in our streaming platform called Streamyard. It will only take 5-10 minutes, so please be sure to get this done in the next two days to ensure all the technical aspects are set.

Dan's availability is as follows:

- Wednesday 12:00-4:30 PM ET
- Thursday 9:30 AM - 4:30 PM ET

Comment in the thread on this post with what time you would like to drop into Streamyard for your AV check and we'll send you the link. (Multiple speakers can do their AV checks at the same time.) If neither of the above time frames work, DM me and we'll find a time that does.

When doing your AV test, please use the computer, browser, camera, and microphone you plan on using for your talk. Sit in the same room you plan to present from and test your screensharing capabilities. In other words, try to recreate exactly what you'll be doing this Friday for the best outcome. Check out [this article by Streamyard](https://support.streamyard.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043291612-Guest-instructions) for more info.

Looking forward to hearing all your talks on Friday!!
