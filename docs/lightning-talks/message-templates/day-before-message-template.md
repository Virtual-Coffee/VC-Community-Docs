Hey speakers! It's almost time. A couple of things before we start tomorrow:

- Please be on Slack and watching for messages from either myself, Bekah, or Dan at least 15 minutes before your talk. Times are scheduled, but things happen. Someone might end early or not be able to attend and you may be asked to present earlier.
- If you're watching the livestream, note that there is a delay. You'll be asked to enter the Streamyard studio before the previous speaker has finished. Also, remember to mute or close out the livestream entirely during your talk.
- When you first enter the Streamyard studio, you'll be able to hear us, but no one will be able to hear you until we add you to the stage. There will be a "Comments" panel on the righthand side where you can see viewer comments. You'll also see a "Private chat" tab. Use that to communicate with us while the person before you is presenting.
- If you need help, support, or someone to pep you up, reach out in this channel or any other VC channel. We all know you're going to do a great job!
