Welcome speakers!!

Thank you for volunteering to share your time, knowledge, and experience with our community!

Lightning Talks will be on {{ day, month date }} starting at {{ time }} EDT. Please let @Meg know if there are times that you prefer. We will do our best to accommodate everyone.

If you cannot present on the {{ date }} or wish to interact with the attendees live via chat, you have the option to submit a pre-recorded Lightning Talk. (Let @Meg know if you want to do this.) For those presenting live, we're encouraging participants to ask questions by tagging you in the `#vc-events` channel so you can answer the questions as you're available. We encourage you all to consider submitting a [Lunch & Learn idea](https://virtualcoffee.io/lunch-and-learn-idea/) and letting the participants know that you're planning on developing your topic further.

Lastly, check out the Speaker Guide located in this channel's canvas. You can access it by clicking on the button in the top right corner that looks like a note with a plus sign.

If you have any questions or comments, please reply in a thread on this post or DM @Meg. As always, we want to support you in whatever way best suits your needs.
