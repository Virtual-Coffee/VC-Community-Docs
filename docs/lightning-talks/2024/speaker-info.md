    The Virtual Coffee Effect
  </dd>
  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>
    It’s always been about the impact, the ripple that goes into the industry. We’ve intentionally never encouraged a transactional atmosphere in our community; we’ve sought to create “An intimate community, optimized for you,” because we believe in people, in growth, and relationships. This is what makes Virtual Coffee different and will continue to differentiate us from large communities: At our core, we believe in people and want to create an environment where we encourage people to grow together in healthy ways.
  </dd>
  <dt>Bio</dt>
  <dd>
    Bekah graduated from a coding bootcamp in May of 2019 and since then has spent time as a frontend developer, started the Virtual Coffee developer community, spent time in DevRel and has continued to mom her four kids. She currently co-hosts the Virtual Coffee podcast, works as the Developer Experience Lead at OpenSauced, tries to work on OSS projects, and lifts heavy things in her free time.
