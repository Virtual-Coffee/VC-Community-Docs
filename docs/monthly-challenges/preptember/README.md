Preptember is the month open source maintainers and contributors prepare themselves for Hacktoberfest.

For this challenge, we have two tracks. Maintainers will review their open-source repos with our repository checklist to ensure their projects are ready for Hacktoberfest contributions. Contributors will look at their favorite repos, evaluate them based on the guide, and write good issues to fulfill the criteria.

Since September 2023, we have provided a [VC Preptember repository](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/vc-preptember) for our members to practice open source and to list repositories that we can verify for Hacktoberfest based on our [Repository Checklist](https://virtualcoffee.io/resources/developer-resources/open-source/maintainer-guide#repository-checklist).

:::tip

Read our [Monthly Challenge Facilitators Handbook](../facilitators-docs/README.md) to learn how to handle tasks before and after challenges, as well as the technical guidelines.

## Special Tasks

The special task for this challenge is to prepare the [vc-preptember repository](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/vc-preptember) for contribution.

### Todo

Two weeks before the challenge:

- Create new markdown files called `preptember-participants-YYYY.md` and `repositories-list-YYYY.md`.

  Change `YYYY` to the year of the challenge.

- Archive old files in the `past-preptembers` folder.

### Kick-Off Announcement 2024

```text
Itâ€™s now September and that means it is time for the Preptember Challenge!

We have two main strands planned for this month's challenge.

  - The [repository](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/vc-preptember) where contributors and aspiring contributors can practice a real contribution flow on GitHub, and maintainers or seasoned contributors can add repositories to the list to recommend for Hacktoberfest month.
  - The OpenSauced maintainers and contributors courses. Stay tuned for specifics of our program around these courses.

Let's get into the spirit of the fall and use this Challenge to get prepared for next month's Hacktoberfest ðŸŽƒ
```
