For September, the monthly challenge is to prepare for participating in Hacktoberfest. As part of this we would like to use a weekly check-in to keep each other informed on our progress and provide a place to answer any questions about the challenge this month and next month.

## What is a check-in?

This will be based of the model of stand-ups. A series of questions to give a quick update on your current progress. Usually held a start of the day so all team members can get a quick update on where everyone is. There is usually a set time limit and only one person talks at a time.

### Questions

#### What did you do this week?

What did you accomplish this week(since the last update)?

#### What are you doing next week?

What do you plan to do next week. Any particular goals you want to meet before the end of the week?

#### Do you have any blockers?

A blocker is something keeping you from your goal. A problem you need some help to resolve. Anything members of VC can help with. VC members can give you some quick tips. For more involved answers you can set up a one on one discussion outside of the check-in or ask any questions in the #monthly-challenge channel.

## Virtual Coffee Check-in Script

"Hello everyone,
Thanks for coming to today's Preptember check-in. The way check-in works is we each spend about 1-2 minutes answering the following questions:

Ask these questions during the first week or for new attendees: - How do you plan to participate in Hacktoberfest? as a maintainer, a contributer, or both? - As a contributor what repos are you looking at to create issues? - As a maintainer are you preparing your repo for Hacktoberfest?

Ask these questions each week: - What did you do this week? - What do you plan on working on next week?

Do you have questions about participating in ths challenge? Ask them, we may have answers!
(Pause here for questions)

You can mention any roadblocks or blockers that you're looking for help with. If you haven't worked on anything since your last check-in or in this challenge so far it's fine to say, "no updates, still planning on tackling \{next steps\} soon."

If anyone wants to discuss people's roadblocks/blockers afterwards, feel free to reach out to each other after the standup in the #monthly-challenge channel.

Please remember to try and keep your updates brief. There should be no need to rush but we try to be respectful of everyone's time here.
I'll start..."
