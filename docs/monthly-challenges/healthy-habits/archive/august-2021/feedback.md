The month started well and the motivation went down in the middle of the month.
Next time, more interaction will be necessary.

Aurelie noticed some good feedback from a resource shared on Slack about how to track a habit with a bullet journal.
Maybe having some VC templates that members can download / print can be a good idea.

More guidance can be useful as well: a lot of members had a lot of new habits they wanted to try for the challenge, maybe asking for one or two is enough (reduce the risk of stopping).

Finding a common healthy habit can be an idea as well (based on opt-in) to have a support group on a common goal.

Having a good animation of the event seems critical. Finding multiple people to host Zoom calls and have it scheduled in advance is something that can help.
