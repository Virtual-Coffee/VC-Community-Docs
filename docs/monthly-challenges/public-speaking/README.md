# Public Speaking: Find Your Voice

During this month, we'll be breaking down the art of public speaking into manageable steps, focusing on different aspects each week. Throughout the month, we'll provide resources, tips, and opportunities to practice and get feedback from the community.

We close this challenge on Friday, the last week of the month, with the Lightning Talk. Check out [lightning-talks](/lightning-talks/README.md) for detailed information.
