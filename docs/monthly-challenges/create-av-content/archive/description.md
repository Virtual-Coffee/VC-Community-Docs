## Theme

"Show your work! Creating Audio/Visual content"

## Goals

- To present knowledge and showcase understanding
- To explore video and audio mediums for sharing knowledge
- To highlight achievements
- To promote growth through sharing

## How It Works

- We're asking members to submit lunch-and-learns, youtube videos, podcasts, or some other form of audio of video content they created that explores a coding-related concept--there's no length requirement
- <Someday at the end of the month>, we'll have a day of lightning talks where folks can showcase their talents and abilities.
- We encourage to post ideas, questions, and even fears in Slack. The goal is to learn and grow together!
- Keep in mind that we know that sharing can be hard, but it also provides a ton of value by:
  - Solidifying ideas.
  - Allows you to be a resource for others.
  - Invites personal growth through conversations sparked by your sharing.
  - Demonstrates your ability to talk through a concept

We'll wrap up our challenge with lightning talks and have a space for members to submit their own AV content on our site.

## Infrastructure Needed

- Lightning talk day prep (Admin available to moderate, host, handle stream setup and communications)
- Lunch-and-learn admin member availability for lunch-and-learn days (standard zoom + zencastr setup)
- Website update with space for folks to add their topics and links
