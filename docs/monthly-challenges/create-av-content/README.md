For this challenge, members present their knowledge, highlighting their achievements, and showcase their understanding by exploring video and audio mediums. They might do that by giving Lunch & Learns, creating YouTube videos, recording podcasts, or some other form of audio or video content they created that explores a coding-related concept — there's no length requirement.

We believe this provides value by solidifying ideas, creating a resource for others, inviting personal growth through conversations sparked by sharing, and demonstrating their ability to talk through a concept.
