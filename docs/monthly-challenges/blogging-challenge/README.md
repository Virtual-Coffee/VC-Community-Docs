A Community Challenge to hit a word count goal for all our tech blogs.

Based off the [NaNoWriMo (National Novel Writing Month)](https://nanowrimo.org/) Challenge, this challenge is the tech take on writing and working together towards the goal while posting on our own blogs.

> [!TIP]
> Read our [Monthly Challenge Facilitators Handbook](../facilitators-docs/README.md) to learn how to handle tasks before and after challenges, as well as the technical guidelines.

## Special Tasks

The special task for this challenge is to prepare an Airtable form for adding blog post entries, which is typically handled by our Technology Support Maintainer, Dan Ott.

### Todo

Two weeks before the challenge, remind the maintainer to prepare the form.

## Async Check-Ins Time

Fridays, 9:00 AM ET

## Prompts

Below are previous prompts for our kick-off announcements and async check-ins.

It‚Äôs now November and that means it is time for our **Blogging Challenge**!

Based on the NaNoWriMo (National Novel Writing Month) Challenge, this challenge is the tech and non-tech take on writing and working together towards the goal while posting on our own blogs.

This month‚Äôs challenge will take place in #monthly-challenge and #content-creation. Our initial goal is to hit 50,000 words as a community, but don't worry, there'll be a stretch goal if we shoot past it! Do make sure you fill out the form linked on the challenge page so we can track your contribution towards our goal.

You can check out the full challenge details, check out resources to help you, and find the form [here](https://virtualcoffee.io/monthlychallenges/nov-2024).

@Leo will be running weekly async check-ins starting next Friday.
