Welcome to the Monthly Challenges docs! These docs are written to support our wonderful volunteers. ✨

:::note[Friendly Reminder]

Volunteering for Virtual Coffee should never stress you out. We value your help and support, but we know that can vary from month to month. Just let us know if you need to take some time off from volunteering. We're happy to support you.

## What are Monthly Challenges?

Every month, we create a challenge for our Virtual Coffee members to complete together. These monthly challenges allow members to learn, grow, and receive support and mentorship.

Each month's challenge will have a theme and weekly goals for the members to work on. Instructions, resources, and additional help for the challenges are provided in the `#monthly-challenge` channel in Slack. Our Monthly Challenge Team Leads and Maintainers plan, organize, and facilitate these challenges.

We have developers at all stages and in many different roles, so we want to ensure any member can participate in these challenges.

## Monthly Challenges Guidelines

The [Monthly Challenge Facilitators Handbook](./facilitators-docs/) provides guidelines for facilitating monthly challenges.

Every challenge requires different preparation and execution. Navigate to the [`monthly-challenges`](../monthly-challenges/) folder and read the README file in each challenge's folder to learn how to conduct it.

Our Monthly Challenge Team Leads maintain the Annual Monthly Challenges Plan, which is available in Google Docs and pinned to the `#vc-monthly-challenge-team` channel on Slack.

If you have ideas about a theme we can do as a community, please let our Monthly Challenge Team Leads know for consideration.

**Thank you all for supporting Virtual Coffee!** 💖
