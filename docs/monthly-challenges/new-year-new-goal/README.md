### Kick-Off Announcement 2024

```text
It’s now 2024 and that means it is time for the New Year, New Goals challenge!

The new year is the perfect time to set your new goals. Whether learning new dev-related things, preparing yourself to get a new job, making new habits to be a better developer or anything you work towards this year. During this month, we'll work on setting up your goals for the year and break them into achievable goals for each month.

This month’s challenge will take place in `#monthly-challenge`. Watch out for the prompts and post your progress during the challenge! The Coffee Table Groups are also working with the monthly challenge, so watch out for their announcements. Accountabilibuddies is also a great place chat goals and/or get some friendly accountability for actually completing those goals during the year!
