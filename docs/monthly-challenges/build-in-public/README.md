In this challenge, we're working on creating a habit of talking about the things we're working on, a plan for continuing progress, and creating a demo for the Virtual Coffee community.

We aim to learn to communicate around a project, show the development process, give confidence, and be proud of any progress made.

In 2021, we dedicated June to the Build in Public challenge and July to Demo Day. Since July 2022, we have combined them into one challenge.

Share your progress with us! 🙌

### Demo Day 2023

```text
  Hey friends!

  In the past, we’ve done a demo day on the last Friday of the month. If you’re interested, respond with a ✋.

  It's usually a short 5 to 10-minute demo, and your project doesn’t have to be complete.

  If you're comfortable, we can put the demo up on YouTube, but we don’t need to. If you'd rather do some feedback session, we can work on that too.
```
