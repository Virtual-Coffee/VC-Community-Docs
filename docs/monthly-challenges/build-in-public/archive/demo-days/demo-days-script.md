## Intro

Hello and welcome to Demo Days! We have a lot of great projects being demoed today.

Each of our presenters will be giving a 5-7 minute overview of their project they worked on this month. I encourage you to put your questions and feedback in the chat. I'll be keeping track of that for our presenters, and we'll try to get to everything. But also feel free to DM our presenters or put it in the monthly-challenge channel.

First we'll have...

## Ending

Thank you all so much for being here, and especially to our presenters who did such a wonderful job. We're really looking forward to seeing how this projects progress! We'll see you all next month for our new challenge, "Healthy Habits for Healthy Devs" (Is that what it's called?)

## Tips

- Ask presenters for all their links (deployed projects, github repo, etc.) beforehand. It would be worth it to have someone keep track of the chat and to drop those links for each person.
- Remind all presenters that we have a tight schedule and that part of this challenge is sticking to the time constraints.
- Ask presenters to begin with a very short intro (who you are, what you do, your project) It was also nice to know what tech was being used.
- If the presenters hit 6:30, unmute your microphone and say something like "We're getting to the end of our time, is there one last thing you'd like to highlight?"

## Recording

- Record all videos to the cloud in zoom.
- Stop (don't pause) the recording between presenters. And then restart for the next presenter. (This breaks up the videos for you.)
- Download the videos and put them in this [google drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1yZ_a_z6BAyIw4f-ngC7Kru7zDjB-U89L)
