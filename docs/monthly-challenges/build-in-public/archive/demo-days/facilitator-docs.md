## What to do to complete the challenge

### Standup

_To complete the challenge, you must complete 15 standups._

- This should be set up as a remind in the channel:

Remind #monthly-challenge to “Demo in public standup time!
:calendar: (:calendar: ) What did you do yesterday?
:x: (:x: ) What blockers do you have?
:goal_net: (goal-net) What goals do you have today?” at 11AM every weekday.

### Demo Day - 10 minutes a piece

- Doesn't need to be complete
- Can be async
- Take the last L&L slot of the month.
