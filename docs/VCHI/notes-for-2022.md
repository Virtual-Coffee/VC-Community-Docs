## hacktoberfest.virtualcoffee.io

- Add a field for time zone for mentors and contribs if they want mentorship
- Set clear dates for opening and closing registration
- Brainstorm different approaches to pairing (mentor pairing mixer or self-selection of mentors -- for example, a list of each mentor with their specialties, availibilities, etc. Then a mentee can select which mentor they want, but the button or whatever used to select will be disabled)
- To ask for mentors, it should be members only. So a checkbox for "are you a member", input for slack un, and if you check are you a member, a would you like 1:1 mentorship appears
  - _it's important to say 1:1 mentorships bc we can have general mentors who hang out in the hacktoberfest channel, or answer in OSS channel_
