## Mentors

- Mentors will support contributors either generally (in the Hacktoberfest co-working room), pair programming on issues, and/or 1:1 level.
- They'll be paired as needed with contributors
- Added to Maintainer and Mentor channel
- Ask to sign up for office hours

## Maintainers

- Maintainers projects will be verified and listed on the MC page along with other projects from the discussion.
- VCHI(VC Hacktoberfest Initiative) Maintainers get extra support from the VC Maintainers with their projects.

## Contributors

- Contributors will be working towards the 4PRs either with our maintainers or other repos.
  - Maybe a threaded, pinned post in the MC channel could be a good way to keep track of things. If you posted something that ppl could reply to with the number of PRs, issues they're working on, and can update that as they complete more could be good. Also, shoutouts to members who hit 4.
  - Get a tweet from VC account when they hit 4?
