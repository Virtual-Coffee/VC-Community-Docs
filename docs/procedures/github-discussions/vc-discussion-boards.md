## Introduction

Welcome to the Virtual Coffee contributors community! This guide will help you navigate our [**Github Discussions**](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/VC-Community-Docs/discussions), the primary platform for our community communications.

## Why Github Discussions?

We chose GitHub Discussions because they are:

- User-friendly
- Accessible
- Permanent for referencing past conversations
- Flexible for various communication needs

## Finding and Creating Discussions

### How to Find a Discussion

1. Navigate to the [Discussions](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/VC-Community-Docs/discussions) tab.
2. Use pinned discussions for quick access to important topics.
3. Browse by category or use the search function.

### How to Create a New Discussion

1. Click the [New Discussion](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/VC-Community-Docs/discussions/new) button.
2. Choose an appropriate category and title.
3. Provide context in your initial post.
4. For questions, use the "Question" format to mark accepted answers.

## Best Practices

- Check existing discussions and issues before creating a new one.
- Provide sufficient context in your posts.
- Be patient with responses, as we're all volunteers.
- For time-sensitive matters, contact a maintainer directly.

## Types of Discussions

### Good Discussion Topics

- New event or project ideas
- Suggestions for changes
- Feedback requests
- Q&A
- Polls

### What Doesn't Belong in Discussions

- Official action items (use Issues instead)
- Official documentation (added by maintainers to the repository)

## Discussion Resolution

Discussions can be resolved by:

- Marking as "Answered"
- Converting to an Issue for actionable tasks
- Pinning for ongoing relevance
- Closing if no longer relevant

Maintainers may:

- Move discussions to more appropriate categories
- Convert Issues to Discussions when needed
- Hide inappropriate replies

## Notification Settings
