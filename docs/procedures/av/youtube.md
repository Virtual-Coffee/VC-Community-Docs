## Examples

- Title:
  > Using a Person-centered approach in tech – BekahHW – Virtual Coffee Lunch & Learn
- Description:

  > Tech can be so detached from people. We have users and developers and titles. And sometimes, we forget that there are human beings with complex lives behind those titles. This talk both acknowledges that and focuses on the importance of community, psychological safety, being open to growing as part of every experience.
  >
  > Bekah graduated from the Flatiron School Software Engineering program in May of 2019 and since then she has started a consultancy specializing in front-end development, created a developer community called Virtual Coffee, stayed active on Twitter and in tech-related slack groups, spoke on podcasts and at conferences, and has continued to mom her four kids. Prior to tech, she spent 10 years teaching college English, three years organizing events and community, and fully embraces being a writer of many genres: code, non-fiction, screenplay, poetry, curriculum.
