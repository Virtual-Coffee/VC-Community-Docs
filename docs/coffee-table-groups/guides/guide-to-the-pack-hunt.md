## Pack Hunt Activities

In general, material building (cover letters, portfolios, resumes, etc.) and related intensive job hunt support should be directed toward the `#tech-interview-study-group` and `#job-hunt` Slack channels, but short reviews, questions, and support will always be allowed in The Pack Hunt if other attendees have the bandwidth to help.

## Host Duties

Be sure to read through the [Guide to Hosting a Coffee Table Group](guide-to-hosting-a-coffee-table-group.md) documentation to gain an understanding of what is expected of you as a Coffee Table Host.

Read on for additional info specific to Pack Hunt Hosts.

### Greeting Attendees

Remember to share [the dedicated Pomodoro timer link](#resources) in the Zoom's group chat during the **Check-ins & Goals** portion of the session so other attendees can join.

It is recommended that all participants mute their microphones during each Pomodoro session as to disturb others. If anyone joins during one of the Pomodoro sessions, greet them via the Zoom chat and re-paste the Pomodoro timer link so they can join the group with as little disruption as possible.
