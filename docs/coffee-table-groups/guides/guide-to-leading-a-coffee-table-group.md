## Coffee Table Group Lead Responsibilities

A Coffee Table Group Lead creates a space and context for conversation. A Lead hosts events on a consistent schedule, comes up with topics to discuss for each event, and encourages attendess. They set expectations for attendees via clear communication about scheduling and giving new members context when they join.

Most Coffee Table Group Leads also act as a Host, so it's important for you to be familiar with the content in our [Guide to Hosting a Coffee Table Group](guide-to-hosting-a-coffee-table-group.md). It is a requirement to have a Lead and a Host (two separate people) for an event to become a new Coffee Table Group. Therefore, the Lead is also responsible for maintaining and coordinating at least one Co-host at all times.

## Guidelines

- If using the VC events CMS, have 1-2 group leads willing to keep the CMS up to date and communicate with the Coffee Table Groups Coordinator
- If there are any major changes, like descriptions, frequency, etc. communicate with the Coffee Table Groups Coordinator to keep the site and documentation up to date
- Adherence to the [Code of Conduct](https://virtualcoffee.io/code-of-conduct)
- Use of the [COC violation form](https://virtualcoffee.io/report-coc-violation/) rather than trying to take care of Code of Conduct violations yourself
- Clearly relate any guidelines or requirements to members of your group
  - For example let them know if they must commit to leading a session, must have a specific experience level, etc.

## Best Practices

Each Coffee Table Group will have its own approach and personality, but it's important to create an environment where your group members feel supported and know what to expect. Here are some tips to help establish a healthy group:

### Group Format

Determine the schedule, type, and format for your group:

- Will you meet weekly, monthly, or some other way?
- Will it always be a synchronous meeting?
- Will you have async check-ins in between meetings?

### Expectations

- What type of meeting is it? (Q&amp;A, presentation, small group convo, pair programming, interactive, etc.)
- Is there material that needs to be covered?
- Will members be asked to lead a session?
- Are other volunteers needed? (i.e. Hosts)
- Are there expectations for communication among the Coffee Table Group members? Where will you be communicating? (Slack channel, only in zoom, etc.)
- Are there expectations for communicating in a video chat? (for example, using the hand raise function, doing an intro, etc.)
- Please provide the following links in video meetings:
  - [Code of Conduct](https://virtualcoffee.io/code-of-conduct/)
  - [COC Violation Form](https://virtualcoffee.io/report-coc-violation/)

### Ending a Group

If your group is an ongoing group, you may find that you don't have the time or energy to continue leading. That's okay. It's really important that all volunteers know that it is always okay to prioritize their mental and physical health.

Rather than discontinuing the group by not scheduling a new one, see if anyone in the group or the larger VC community is willing to take on the responsibility. Communicate with your Coffee Table Group about the need for a new Lead. If you're unable to do so, let the Coffee Table Groups Coordinator know.
