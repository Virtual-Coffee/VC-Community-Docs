6. Add their event to the CMS calendar, and let them know they can edit it.
7. Explain how using the VC Zoom, announcements bot, and site event page work.

   - Use #vc-events-admin channel to get Zoom link and host code. Ensure you have no overlap with other VC events, as there is only one Zoom account.

   - The VC site [events page](https://virtualcoffee.io/events) will also display the event pulled from the CMS.
