Our Coffee Table Groups have been one of the most popular and valuable features for members of our community. Coffee Table Groups are small, special interest groups created and run by members. They can involve Zoom meetings, async Slack hangouts, or anything else that the members would like to do.

## Definition

A group of VC members with a common interest who would like to cultivate it through more intimate and scheduled conversation. These events are member-led, developed, and driven for other VC members. Coffee Table Groups adhere to the [Virtual Coffee Code of Conduct](https://virtualcoffee.io/code-of-conduct) and hold community feedback in the highest regard. The result is a meetup with a smaller group that will implement suggestions. Because these groups are part of the VC community, there may be industry veterans in attendance, willing to engage and connect, or the Lead may encourage attendees to speak with specific VC members per topic of conversation.

## Benefits

- Zoom rooms hosted by Virtual Coffee
- Events appear in `#announcements` and on the [Virtual Coffee events page](https://virtualcoffee.io/events)
- Reminders during Coffees and other official events
