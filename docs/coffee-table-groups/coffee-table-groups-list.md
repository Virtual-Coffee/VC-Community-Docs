### Accountabilibuddies

You want to learn that new tool, finish up that blog post, or send that job application, but you’re so busy that the day is over before you know it. Join us and add some fun and friendly accountability to your schedule!

Drop into our sessions whenever and for however long your schedule allows. No matter the goal, you’ll find encouragement and support alongside your Accountabilibuddies!

### The Pack Hunt

Job hunting as a collective: An accountability session exclusively for job hunting. Support each other by being present and sharing your goals, target roles, and resources. Let's collaborate as we apply for jobs, reach out to recruiters, and scroll LinkedIn for leads. "Hunt with the pack! Arwoooo...!!!"

### Frontend Friday Folks Fighting CSSBattle.dev

On Fridays, we solve a new puzzle at [CSSBattle.dev](https://cssbattle.dev/). We meet in the `#co-working-room` for this Coffee Table Group, and can move our meeting to a breakout room so as not to disturb any co-working VC members. Feel free to join us and learn more about CSS! If you can't make it, be sure to play along on your own and post your answers in [Virtual Coffee's CSS Battles Discussion board](https://github.com/orgs/Virtual-Coffee/discussions/categories/css-battles)!

### Feelings Friday

Feelings Friday was started at the Flatiron School coding bootcamp by its founders, Avi Flombaum & Adam Enbar, after they noticed burnout among their first cohorts. Join a supportive group where everyone has the opportunity to share what’s on their mind in a safe environment. It's a great way to unwind at the end of the week!

### Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Office Hours

Feel free to gather a group of friends and start your own read-through for a book.
