## Before Breakout Rooms

### Pre-Chat

Welcome all new faces via chat and let them know we will get started and will be generally chatting for about 5 minutes to let everyone get settled.

Pre-chat chaos.

### Welcome

_While the welcome is happening, the zoom host of the day creates the breakout rooms_

Hello, and welcome to Virtual Coffee!

We’ve been doing this since April 2020, and we’ve loved the growth we’ve seen. Virtual Coffee's mission is to be a welcoming tech community that allows room for growth and mentorship at all levels, and to create meaningful opportunities for learning, leadership, and contribution for everyone. To find our events or to learn more, you can check out our website virtualcoffee.io.

Just some quick reminders, be considerate of everyone in the group, we’re all equals here. I'm going to drop some links in the chat now and talk about them for a minute:

Sometimes what seems like an awkward silence might be an opportunity for someone else to express their thoughts.

We are an international community, and sometimes things get lost in translation. Let's lead with kindness, and recognize that the impact of our words matters. If things feel uncomfortable in any way reach our or use a COC violation form.

We take our Code of Conduct seriously. We expect everyone to abide by the COC, whether that's during an event, in slack, or in DMs.

We also have a COC violation submission form, which I dropped with the links. This is another option that allows you to stay anonymous when you report any violations.

We want to welcome all of our new friends here. If you would like to join our slack, please indicate in your introduction that you're new here so our notetakers can indicate that in the notes. You'll receive a slack invite by the end of the day.

We'll be moving into breakout rooms in a minute, for more intimate conversation. When you get in the room, your room leader will start the introductions and explain the handraise function. You'll say your name, where you're from, what you do, and answer today's random question. We're so grateful to our room leaders and notetakers, who are community members who have been around for a while. One of the things we love about this community is how we support each other in the ways we can. At about five minutes to the hour, we'll come back together as a big group for some closing announcements.

We just wrapped up [whatever event], and now we have some great things coming up: [list events].

If you have questions or comments, please feel free to reach out to us at hello@virtualcoffee.io and follow us on Twitter @VirtualCoffeeIO. We're always here to support you and to answer any questions.

For other announcements check out our newsletter page: virtualcoffee.io/newsletter and if you want to hear more about our awesome community members, definitely check out the podcast!

Have a great day, everyone!

## Outro / Closing

_Details for these announcements can be found in the [newsletter](https://virtualcoffee.io/newsletter/)_

We want to be respectful of everyone's time, so we've got a couple of announcements before we leave. Thank you all for being here and welcome all our new friends. The notes will be posted in slack soon!
