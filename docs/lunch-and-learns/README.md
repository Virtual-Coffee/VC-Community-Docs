# VC Lunch & Learns

Lunch & Learn talks are usually hour-long sessions on one topic. It can be a traditional conference-style talk, panel discussion, question and answer, or a combination.

We try to keep Lunch & Learns to Fridays at 12pm Eastern. Members can submit an idea for an event [on the website](https://virtualcoffee.io/lunch-and-learn-idea/).
