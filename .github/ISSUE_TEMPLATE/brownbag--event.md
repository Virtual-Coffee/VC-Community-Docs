## Workflow Timeline

### Scheduling a Brownbag

#### Brownbag Session Request Is Submitted

#### Brownbag Session Request Is Received

- [ ] The LC and DW receive the form submission.
- [ ] The DW opens up a PR using the Brownbag Session Pull Request template.

##### Scheduling Workflow

1. The LC checks the calendar for availability in order of the Speaker's preferred dates.

   a. If any of the Speaker's suggested time slots are available, continue to next step.
   b. If none of the Speaker's suggested time slots are available, the LC reaches out to the Speaker to ask for additional time slot options or to postpone the Brownbag until a later date:

   [LINK NEW TIME SLOTS EMAIL TEMPLATE] <!-- TODO -->

   Go back to Step 1. Iterate until the Speaker submits a time slot that's listed as available on the calendar.

2. The LC confirms availability of a leadership team member to act as the Host.
3. The LC confirms availability of an Moderator.

   a. If one of the Speaker's suggested time slots has been agreed on by both the Host and Moderator, the LC sends a follow-up email to the Speaker:

   [LINK EMAIL FOLLOW-UP TEMPLATE] <!-- TODO -->

   b. If none of the Speaker's suggested time slots work for the Host and/or Moderator, the LC reaches out to the Speaker to ask for additional time slot options or to postpone the Brownbag until a later date:

   [LINK NEW TIME SLOTS EMAIL TEMPLATE] <!-- TODO -->

   Go back to Step 1. Iterate these steps until a time slot is agreed upon.

4. The LC adds the Brownbag to the Virtual Coffee Google calendar and invites both the Moderator and the Speaker.
5. The LC adds the Brownbag event on [meetingplace.io](https://meetingplace.io/virtual-coffee/events).

### Creating a New Brownbag Issue

Once the Brownbag is confirmed and scheduled, the DW adds the information the Speaker submitted via the Brownbag form to the PR and adjusts instructions per role throughout the rest of this template, depending on recording and privacy settings. The DW assigns the Moderator to this Brownbag issue and the Moderator is responsible for moving the issue card through the project board.
