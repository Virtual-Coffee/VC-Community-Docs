# Hosts

## Initial Actions

- Start zoom session
- Create co-hosts for those doing room leadership/conversation facilitation by clicking on their image card in Zoom and assign co-host
- Start breakout rooms

### Create breakout rooms

- Click the breakout room icon,
- Select the number of rooms according to the number of potential rooms. For example, if we know we need four rooms, with a possible of five, select five rooms. You can leave a room empty, but you can't add a room after you've selected the number.
- Choose assign **manually** (This is really important. It allows you to add people after they join.)
- Check Slack for any messages about how many rooms we need.
- Pair each co-host with their notetaker
- Change the name of the breakout room to the co-host/notetaker pair
- Assign members into rooms as they come in
  -  Do your best to create breakout rooms that include a variety of participant types. For example, if you know there are members who will keep the conversation going, assign them to different rooms. If there are new folks, try not to put them all in the same room. If there's a newer room leader, try to add someone to their room that could support them if they need it. The goal is to have well-balanced rooms when possible. It won't ever be perfect for every room, but the goal is to try to balance participant types.
- Once rooms are paired and opening remarks are done, click "Open All Rooms"
  _Note: The host has to assign themselves to a room_

### Once in room

- If a person joins late, a notification shows up in Breakout Rooms. Assign new attendees to a room (try to keep all about the same size).
- When there's about 7 minutes left, send a message to all rooms that we'll be rejoining the group in about two minutes
- At five minutes to the hour, close all breakout rooms
