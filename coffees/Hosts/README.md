# Hosts

Welcome! Thank you for your interest in being a Host for our VC Coffee Chats. Like most roles here, while the concept is straightforward, there can be a lot of nuance, so we've tried as best as we can to provide clear-cut instructions where we're able.

## Responsibilities

The Host is responsible for:

- Creating the breakout rooms
- Assigning attendees to those breakout rooms, including volunteer Room Leaders and Note Takers
- Managing incoming attendees throughout the Zoom session
- Notifying the breakout rooms when it is time to wrap up
- Closing the breakout rooms
- Ending the Zoom meeting

## A Detailed Breakdown

A VC Coffee Chat can largely be split into four (4) phases:

- **Pre-coffee chat:** Before the event begins when attendees gather and chaos ensues
- **Opening announcements:** The Coffee Chat has started with the MC giving the introduction
- **Main discussion:** The majority of the event in which attendees are split into breakout rooms
- **Wrap up:** Everyone has returned to the main Zoom room and the MC promotes some upcoming events

### During the Pre-coffee Chat and Opening Announcements

Upon joining the Zoom, you should quickly receive Host permission from the MC (or a present Maintainer). If not, gently remind them as it can get a bit chaotic sometimes during pre-coffee chat. As soon as you have Host permission, you should begin your duties.

#### Assigning Co-hosts

Assign Co-host permission to the MC, Room Leaders, and Note Takers as they join the Zoom. To do this, open the Participants list and hover over their name. Click the 'More â–¿' button and select the 'Make co-host' option.

#### Creating Breakout Rooms

During this time you'll also want to create breakout rooms. Click the breakout rooms icon to open Zoom's Breakout Rooms modal.

Enter the number of breakout rooms according to the post in `#vc-room-leaders-note-takers` and select **Assign manually** from the radio button options, then click the 'Create' button.

Rename each breakout room after each Room Leader/Note Taker pairing. This will help you when you begin assigning attendees to breakout rooms.

In the end, your naming format should reflect something similar to the below screenshot, displaying "Room Leader Name & Note Taker Name" as the room name.

Continue to grant Co-host permission and add our volunteer Room Leaders and Note Takers to their appropriate breakout rooms as they join the session.

## Tips

Stay froggy and keep Slack open!

<!--
#### Create breakout rooms

- Click the breakout room icon.
- Select the number of rooms according to the number of potential rooms. You will be able to add rooms later if necessary.
- Choose assign **manually**. (This is really important. It allows you to add people after they join.)
- Check Slack for any messages about how many rooms we need. **Please do coordinate** with the volunteers in the Slack channel as sometimes plans need to be adjusted based on number of participants.
- We try to keep **less than 10 people** per room. Having enough Room Leaders should be prioritized over having enough Note Takers. It is typically advised to pull a Note Taker to a Room Leader position (with their permission) if the alternative would be rooms with more than 10 people. But it's important that _everyone who is placed as a Room Leader volunteered to do so_, either by indication in the official volunteer request earlier in the week or on the day of the meeting.
- Pair each Co-host with their Note Taker.
- _Note_: Sometimes, if the Room Leader is a VC Maintainer/Zoom account owner, you may not see them on the list of attendees to be assigned. This is fine. So long as they're in the meeting, they can join their breakout room themselves.
- Change the name of the breakout room to the Co-host/Note Taker pair.
- Assign members into rooms as they come in.
  - Do your best to create breakout rooms that include a variety of participant types. For example, if you know there are members who will keep the conversation going, assign them to different rooms. If there are new folks, try not to put them all in the same room. If there's a newer Room Leader, try to add someone to their room that could support them if they need it. The goal is to have well-balanced rooms when possible. It won't ever be perfect for every room, but the goal is to try to balance participant types.

### Breakout Room Time

- As soon as the MC is done with the intro and asks if rooms are ready, open up all rooms.
  - _Note: The host has to assign themselves to a room_.
- If a person joins late, a notification shows up in Breakout Rooms. Assign new attendees to a room. (Try to keep all about the same size.)
- At **ten minutes to the hour**, use the broadcast button in the Participants tab to let everyone know the rooms will be closing in 5 minutes.
- At **Five minutes to the hour**, hit the close rooms button.
- Try as best as you can not to delay closing the rooms, as it burdens the MC to squeeze all the final announcements in on time.

### Final Announcements

- As the Host, the Zoom does not officially end until you close it. You can close as soon as the MC completes their announcements and we do our usual group goodbye and wave. :)
