# Topics

_Virtual Coffee started out of a need for community, out of a need for conversation. We're not a meetup. We believe in a person-first approach, where we recognize that each person is a complex human being who isn't defined by their tech stack, etc. Conversations are often focused on tech, because that's what most of us do, but they don't have to be limited to tech._

## Here are some topics we frequently visit at VC:

- education
- community
- communication (and misunderstandings)
- interviewing
- mental health
- worklife/balance
- hobbies
- navigating challenges
- wellness
- what excites you
- growth mindset
- networking
- job environments
- asking for help
- documentation
- accessibility
- design
- open source

Please feel free to use these as back-pocket topics at any time. And talk about what feels comfortable to you.
