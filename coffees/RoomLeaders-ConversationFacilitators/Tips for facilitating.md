## Approaches to Different Room and Personality Dynamics

### Strategies when you have the talker
* Interject: Awesome, thank you for sharing. We have a couple quieter individuals with us. I’d love to be intentional about opening the floor up to them.
* Thanks for sharing, you have so much to add to this conversation. I want to respectfully open the floor up to the X people who have their hands raised: Bob, Jane, Jim… in that order.
* Use the chat as a space to open up the conversation
* Repeat the question or topic, and then redirect: "let's hear from someone different on this one." Or, "anyone who hasn't had a chance to speak yet have any ideas?"
* Non-verbal signals work too! 
* If the topic changes, use it as an opportunity to say, "I'd love to get a variety of opinions here." You can go a step further and if there are a number of hands raised, say "I'm going to prioritize calling on those who haven't had the chance to speak yet today."
* Remember: Room Leaders are facilitators and participants. As a facilitator your purpose is to encourage others to share, and as a participant you can share as well. As a participant try to follow the same protocols as other participants, and avoid taking on the role of a "talk show host".
