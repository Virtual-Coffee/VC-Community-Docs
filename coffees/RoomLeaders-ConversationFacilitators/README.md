# Breakout Room Leader Guidelines and Considerations

Thank you for volunteering to be a room leader! We know it can be difficult to both keep track of the conversation and participate, so we appreciate all you’re doing.

As a room leader, your primary job is to ensure that the room is a safe and welcoming space. We want to give everyone a chance to participate, whether through talking or through zoom chat. As a room leader, here are some guidelines and considerations.

## Guidelines once in the room

### Intros:

- Give a reminder for hand raising:
- We love the conversation here. If no one else is talking we encourage you to participate. If the conversation is energized, use the hand raise option to let us know that you want to go next. The moderators will try to keep track of this, but also feel free to point out if someone has raised their hand and the moderator missed it. To access the hand raise button, click on either the participants tab or the reactions options--depending on your zoom version. Just a reminder, you have to lower your hand manually.
- Ask for a note-taker if one isn’t assigned

### Introduce yourself and give instructions:

- We always start with introductions, so say your name, if you want: where you’re from, what you do, and then your answer to {random question}
- If the group is small, you can popcorn or call on participants - your call.

### After intros

Encourage members to bring up a topic--doesn’t have to be tech related--they’re interested in or ask any questions they have; this is a safe space.
If no one has anything (and that includes you), bring up the pre-picked topic

### Considerations

- Members who are late might be assigned to your room. Send them a zoom message about the topic
- Watch for handraises
- Try to keep track of the zoom chat or ask someone else to
- Some members may take longer than others to make a point and that’s okay. However, if you notice someone may be monopolizing the conversation, as kindly as possible, you may need to jump in and allow others to speak.
- You can also use the private zoom chat feature to let people know if there are any disruptive audiovisual issues on their end, or to do check ins with folks to make sure they receive acknowledgement for certain actions as an alternative to publicly inquiring.
- Keep your slack open for any communication and directly message or @ the host if you have problems or need to remove a member
- Removing members is up to your discretion. If you think they’re creating an unsafe space, it is reasonable to remove them
- It is also reasonable to DM them on zoom to give a warning or to ask for something to stop
- If there is an issue, please report it to the #vc-room-leaders-notetakers--this can be done after the coffee
