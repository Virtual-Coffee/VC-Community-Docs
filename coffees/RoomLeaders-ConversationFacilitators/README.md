# Breakout Room Leader Guidelines and Considerations

Thank you for volunteering to be a room leader! We know it can be difficult to both keep track of the conversation and participate, so we appreciate all you’re doing.

As a room leader, your primary job is to ensure that the room is a safe and welcoming space. We want to give everyone a chance to participate, whether through talking or through zoom chat. As a room leader, here are some guidelines and considerations.

## Creating a welcoming space for everyone

### Discussion

_To make this a welcoming space, it's important that as room leaders, you take care of the people in the room, and avoid situations of "getting too into the conversation" and excluding people. If there's jargon being used, ask the speaker to explain it and drop a link in the chat if possible as an additional resource._

#### Coffee Table or PacMan method:

- Coffee Table Method: I love @Glen McCallum’s description: it’s like you’re sitting around a coffee table talking with friends. That means you want to engage everyone in conversation as much as possible.
- [The Pacman Method](https://www.ericholscher.com/blog/2017/aug/2/pacman-rule-conferences/): in conferences and meetups, you always leave room in the circle for someone else to join the conversation. And the same thing should happen in your room.

## Guidelines once in the room

### Intro Script:
#### Introduce yourself and give instructions:

- Hi, I'm {your name}, and I'll be your room leader today. We have {name} as our notetaker today as well. We always start with introductions, so you'll say your name, and if you want: where you’re from, what you do, and then your answer to {random question}

- _If the group is small, you can popcorn or call on participants - your call._

- While you're thinking about the answer to our random question, I'll go over some of the considerations for our small group conversation. We love the conversation here. If no one else is talking we encourage you to participate. If the conversation is energized, use the hand raise option to let us know that you want to go next. I'll try to keep track of this, but also feel free to point out if someone has raised their hand and I missed it. To access the handraise button, click on either the participants tab or the reactions options--depending on your zoom version. Just a reminder, you have to lower your hand manually.
- We want this to be a welcoming space and for everyone to participate in the ways that are most comfortable for them. It's perfectly acceptable to be quiet, to be more a listener, to keep your camera off.
- The chat is also a great place to ask questions if that's a more comfortable space.

  - _If a question is asked in the chat: summarize the question, mention their name to verbally bring them into the chat. For example: "Dan had a great question, 'How do you get started with github as a beginner?' Who has thoughts about this to give Dan a great starting place."_

- Ask for a note-taker if one isn’t assigned.


### After intros

Encourage members to bring up a topic--doesn’t have to be tech related--they’re interested in or ask any questions they have; this is a safe space.
If no one has anything (and that includes you), bring up the pre-picked topic

### Considerations

- Members who are late might be assigned to your room. Drop the intro instructions in the chat.
- Watch for handraises
- Try to keep track of the zoom chat or ask someone else to
- Some members may take longer than others to make a point and that’s okay. However, if you notice someone may be monopolizing the conversation, as kindly as possible, you may need to jump in and allow others to speak.
- You can also use the private zoom chat feature to let people know if there are any disruptive audiovisual issues on their end, or to do check ins with folks to make sure they receive acknowledgement for certain actions as an alternative to publicly inquiring.
- Keep your slack open for any communication and directly message or @ the host if you have problems or need to remove a member
- Removing members is up to your discretion. If you think they’re creating an unsafe space, it is reasonable to remove them
- It is also reasonable to DM them on zoom to give a warning or to ask for something to stop
- If there is an issue, please report it to the #vc-room-leaders-notetakers--this can be done after the coffee
