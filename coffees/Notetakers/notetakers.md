# Notetaker guide
- Thanks for being a notetaker! We know it can be challenging to take notes and participate, so we appreciate you volunteering. No one can possibly cover everything, so it's ok to miss things. Just think of it as an opportunity for other members in the room to contribute after the notes are posted.
- Although we assume these coffees and the contributions are covered by the "Friend-DA," we realize that there's a difference between saying something to a group of friends and having a written record. To preserve the privacy of our members and to encourage honesty and vulnerability, we ask that you don't record the names of members during the conversation portion of Virtual Coffee, unless there's an explicit agreement. For example, if someone says "I'm always up to pair on Elm issues," it could be assumed that the member would want the community to know who they should contact.
