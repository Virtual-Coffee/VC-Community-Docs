# Notetaker's Guide

_Thanks for being a notetaker! We know it can be challenging to take notes and participate, so we appreciate you volunteering. No one can possibly cover everything, so it's ok to miss things. Just think of it as an opportunity for other members in the room to contribute after the notes are posted._

## Special Note

- Although we assume these coffees and the contributions are covered by the "Friend-DA," we realize that there's a difference between saying something to a group of friends and having a written record. To preserve the privacy of our members and to encourage honesty and vulnerability, we ask that you **DO NOT record the names of members during the conversation portion of Virtual Coffee**, unless there's an agreement. For example, if someone says "I'm always up to pair on Elm issues," ask the member if you can reference their name in the notes so the VC community knows who they should contact.

## Notes Template

_Initial Conversation here tends to be random and lighthearted, so this section can be skipped. Maybe a notable line or two at the most._
