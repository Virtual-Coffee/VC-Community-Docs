# Coffee Chats

Welcome to the Coffee docs! Thank you all for supporting Virtual Coffee!

Just a friendly reminder that being a room leader/notetaker shouldn't be something that stresses you out. Every person in the room has the opportunity to contribute to the conversation and/or to add notes. 

The goal for Coffees is to be part of a community and not to distance ourselves from it. These docs are to written with the intention of supporting our wonderful volunteers.

## ROLES
#### HOSTS:
The host controls the role assignments and the breakout rooms. They monitor for members who show up late, and control when the rooms are opened and closed.

## MCs:
The MC gives the opening announcements and drops the important links into the chat.

## ROOM LEADERS / CONVERSATION FACILITATORS:
The Room Leaders are the conversation facilitators of the breakout rooms. They give some instructions (handraise function), run the introductions, and make sure everyone is being heard. If no one has a topic, the room leader brings up the "backpocket" topic of choice.

- [Room Leader docs](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/VC-Events/tree/main/coffees/RoomLeaders-ConversationFacilitators)


## NOTETAKERS:
Notetakers take notes on the conversation in the breakout rooms, grab the links that are dropped, and post the notes to slack after Coffee.
