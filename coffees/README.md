# Tues/Thurs Coffees

Welcome to the Coffee docs! Thank you all for supporting Virtual Coffee!

Being a room leader/notetaker shouldn't be something that stresses you out. Every person in the room has the opportunity to contribute to the conversation and/or to add notes. 

The goal for T/R coffees is to be part of a community and not to distance ourselves from it. These docs are to written with the intention of supporting our wonderful volunteers.
