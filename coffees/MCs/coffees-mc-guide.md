## Before Breakout Rooms

### Pre-Chat

Welcome all new faces via chat and let them know we will get started and will be generally chatting for about 5 minutes to let everyone get settled.

Let the pre-chat chaos commence!

### Welcome

_While the welcome is happening, the zoom host of the day creates the breakout rooms._

Hello, and welcome to Virtual Coffee!

We’ve been doing this since April 2020, and we’ve loved the growth we’ve seen. Virtual Coffee's mission is to be a welcoming tech community that allows room for growth and mentorship at all levels, and to create meaningful opportunities for learning, leadership, and contribution for everyone. To find our events or to learn more, you can check out our website virtualcoffee.io.

Just some quick reminders, be considerate of everyone in the group, we’re all equals here. I'm going to drop some links in the chat now and talk about them for a minute:

Code of Conduct: https://virtualcoffee.io/code-of-conduct/

COC Violation Form: https://virtualcoffee.io/report-coc-violation/

New Member Form: https://virtualcoffee.io/membership/{meetingid}

Sometimes what seems like an awkward silence might be an opportunity for someone else to express their thoughts.

Always assume positive intent. We're an international group and sometimes things can be lost in translation.

That said, we do have a Code of Conduct that we take seriously. We expect everyone to abide by the COC, whether that's during an event, in slack, or in DMs.

We also have a COC violation submission form, which I dropped in the chat with the links. This is another option that allows you to stay anonymous when you report any violations.

We want to welcome all of our new friends here. If you would like to become a member, which includes access to our Slack and member-only events, please fill out the New Member Form I dropped in the chat.

We'll be moving into breakout rooms in a minute. When you get in the room, your room leader will start the introductions and explain the hand raise function. You'll say your name, where you're from, what you do, and answer today's random question. At about five minutes to the hour, we'll come back together as a big group for some closing announcements.

### Introductions & Discussion - done in breakout rooms

I want to drop the form for new members in the slack again now in case you missed it before: [https://virtualcoffee.io/membership/{meetingid}]
