## How to Use This Repo

This repo is meant to help facilitate communication and coordination for Virtual Coffee Contributors.

In general, there will be an entire docs section (as well as issue templates, project boards, etc.) for each area of responsibility.

If you have a question or general observation, the [Contributors team discussion board on GitHub](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/VC-Contributors/discussions) would be a great place to start.

> ⚠️ **Heads up!** If you'd like to make a change to this repo's docs, please make sure you've started with an issue (or a discussion board post) first, and that you've been assigned to the issue. This allows the maintainer team to provide guidance and prioritize tasks - otherwise you may run the risk of spending time on something that doesn't end up getting accepted for various reasons. Read our [Contributors' Guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for more info.
