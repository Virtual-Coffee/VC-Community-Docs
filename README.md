## How to use this repo:

This repo is meant to help facilitate communication and coordination for Virtual Coffee events.

In general, there will be an entire docs section (and possibly issue templates, project boards, etc) for each area of responsibility.

If you have a question or general observation, either the [Contributors team discussion board on GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/Virtual-Coffee/teams/contributors) or the discussion board for your specific team (for example, the [Lightning Talk team](https://github.com/orgs/Virtual-Coffee/teams/lightning-talk-team)) would be a great place to start.

> :warning: If you'd like to help improve the docs, please submit an issue or a pull request with your suggestions - the Contributors team has write access but we would like to avoid anyone committing changes directly to `main`.
