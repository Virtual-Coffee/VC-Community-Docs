## How to Use This Repo

This repo is meant to help facilitate communication and coordination for Virtual Coffee events.

In general, there will be an entire docs section (as well as issue templates, project boards, etc.) for each area of responsibility.

If you have a question or general observation, either the [Contributors team discussion board on GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/Virtual-Coffee/teams/contributors) or the discussion board for your specific team (for example, the [Lightning Talk team](https://github.com/orgs/Virtual-Coffee/teams/lightning-talk-team)) would be a great place to start.

**NOTE**: If you'd like to help improve the docs, please see our [`CONTRIBUTING.md` file](CONTRIBUTING.md) for a guide on how to get started. Make sure to submit your Pull Request in a separate branch as we would like to avoid anyone committing changes directly to the main branch.
