Welcome to the Virtual Coffee Newsletter docs! **Thank you all for supporting Virtual Coffee!**

## What is the Virtual Coffee Newsletter?

The Virtual Coffee Newsletter is a monthly publication that shares updates, news, and resources from the Virtual Coffee community.

The newsletter is created by the Newsletter Team Leads and our Maintainers.

The newsletter is shared with the Virtual Coffee community via email and is also available on the [Virtual Coffee website](virtualcoffee.io.)

The newsletter is typically published on the first Monday of each month. The newsletter is usually put together in the week leading up to publication.

> A word on platform. The newsletter is currently published using Mailchimp, however, the platform may change in the future. These docs have purposefully been written to be platform-agnostic. Platform specific instructions may be added in the future by the newsletter team.
