@Rahat Chowdhury 
- Topic Title: Prioritizing Mental Health During the Job Search

- Bio I'm a web developer, blogger, writer, rapper, and Pokemon Master.
- Description:  My main purpose with these talks is to make it easier just to talk about it and remove a lot of the stigma behind it. The job search can be a very long, lonely, and frustrating process. I would love to share my own experiences and hopefully show others they aren't alone in whatever they might be going through.
