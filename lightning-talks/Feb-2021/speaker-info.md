## Talk Description: 
Bob Ross once said "[Coders] are a different breed of people. We’re a happy bunch.” Ok, well that's not what he said. He really said, “We artists are a different breed of people. We’re a happy bunch.” But it would be nice if we all were a happy bunch, right? So let's take some of that Bob Ross wisdom and apply it to dev life. And then maybe we, too, can be a happy bunch.

## Talk Description: 
Layout on web pages has always been a bit of a hack. The first web pages were simply documents, and so HTML (and later, CSS) had tools simply for enhancing the look and feel of a document, as opposed to placing elements in certain areas on a page. At some point designers started trying to make web pages that looked more like magazine articles or computer applications, but had to work with document-related tools to do so. Table layouts, CSS positioning, floats, even flexbox - none of these technologies were initially meant for page layout. CSS Grid is that tool. CSS Grid is powerful and complex, and introduces syntax and concepts to CSS that have not been seen before. This can make getting started with it seem overwhelming even for an experienced developer! In this Lightning Talk, I'm going to concentrate on a small chunk of the CSS Grid spec, and show some examples of how CSS Grid can solve some common-but-annoying layouts with just a few lines of CSS, and if we have time, maybe look at some cool tricks along the way.
