> A template script for the Lightning Talk MC to follow.

# INTRO
- Welcome everyone! We're getting started on time, we just want to give people a couple of minutes to come in and get settled.  

- As we all get settled in, I'll give a brief overview of what we've been up to. Virtual Coffee started as a once a week zoom chat in April 2020, and has grown into a community of devs at all stages of the journey, meeting, mentoring, hosting events, and most importantly, making friends. Our mission is to form community, allow room for growth and mentorship at all levels, and to provide a safe space for everyone interested in tech. To find our code of conduct, events, or to learn more, you can check out our website virtualcoffee.io. 

 - We've started off the year great with a talk every week, the lightning talks today, an active slack, and our continuous Tues/Thursday coffees.

- We're really glad to have you all here with us today, and I especially want to thank our speakers for being here and for the lightning talk team for all the work they put into making this a VC event. 

- Today's event will be livestreamed, recorded, and posted online as individual talks. 

- Because lightning talks are an introduction into a topic, and here at Virtual Coffee a good way to ease into speaking or gauge interest for a brownbag topic, we won't be taking questions as part of the event, but I'll be tagging the speaker and their topic in the #event-chat channel in slack so please feel free to add questions, comments, or general positivity there.

I'm very excited for this, and we're going to kick it off with my talk: The Joy of Dev Life: A Bob Ross Approach.
