## EVENT INTRO

**MEG:**

Welcome everyone to the 2024 Virtual Coffee Lightning Talks! We're your hosts Meg and Bekah, and we're so excited to be here with you today! We're going to take a minute to tell you a bit about the Virtual Coffee community while people are tuning in and getting settled. But first, hi mom!

**BEKAH:**

Virtual Coffee started as a once a week Zoom chat in April of 2020, and has grown into a community of devs at all stages of the journey, meeting, mentoring, hosting events, and most importantly, making friends. Our mission is to be a welcoming tech community that allows room for growth and mentorship at all levels, and to create meaningful opportunities for learning, leadership, and contribution for everyone. To find our code of conduct, events, or to learn more, you can check out our website virtualcoffee.io.

**MEG:**

We're about to wrap up our Find Your Voice monthly challenge, which was all about public speaking. In May, we're going to focus on one of my favorite monthly challenges: Community Kindness. This challenge encourages our members to celebrate one of the things that continually makes the Virtual Coffee community so special: Kindness.

We're so glad to have you all here with us today, and I especially want to thank our speakers for embracing the monthly challenge and signing up to give a talk. Without you, this event wouldn't be possible!

**BEKAH:**

Lightning Talks are meant to be an introduction to a topic. Here at Virtual Coffee we treat them as a good way to ease into public speaking or gauge interest for a possible Lunch & Learn topic, so today we won't be taking questions as part of the event. Instead, we'll be tagging the speaker and their topic in the #vc-events channel in Slack directly after their talk, so please feel free to add questions, comments, or general positivity there. We definitely still want to encourage usage of the livestream chat too, especially when speakers ask the audience questions!

**MEG:**

Are you ready to kick this off, Bekah? I'm very excited about this first talk.
