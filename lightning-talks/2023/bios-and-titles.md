<dd>A Great First Chapter: New Employee Growth & Your Content Pipeline</dd>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>
I am proposing a new model for using technical blogging, friction logs, and other informal types of technical writing as a required part of a new-hire onboarding experience. 

I'll present an outline of how this plan would work in practice and explain the benefits to all parties. New hires learn more deeply, product engineering teams gain greater insight into UX/DX, new employees have a deliverable product during those nebulous early weeks of onboarding, and companies build a stronger content pipeline by identifying and nurturing strong writers. Everyone wins! 

If I were to go into private consulting, I think this model would be part of my 'unique value prop'. This talk is the start of working out the details in my proposal and getting feedback on the idea.

<dt>BIO</dt>
<dd>Julia Seidman is a technical marketing consultant and developer in the Seattle area. She has 2 terrific kids and a wonderful partner, and her family cos-plays as a “normal” family.

Julia is a believer in the careen, rather than the career. 

After studying anthropology and writing a senior thesis on the ethics of museum collections of human skeletal remains, she took the job she could get, which was fundraising for a hospital.

From there, she became a financial analyst and employee educator for 401(k) and pension plans. After that, she got a Master’s in Teaching, and taught high school English, ESL and Debate for most of a decade. 

Now, she works as a freelance technical writer and software developer, specializing in technical content marketing.

Along the way, she has learned a lot about a lot of things, including the Python ecosystem.
