# INTRO
- Welcome everyone! We're getting started on time, we just want to give people a couple of minutes to come in and get settled.  

- As we all get settled in, I'll give a brief overview of what we've been up to. Virtual Coffee started as a once a week zoom chat in April 2020, and has grown into a community of devs at all stages of the journey, meeting, mentoring, hosting events, and most importantly, making friends. Our mission is to form community, allow room for growth and mentorship at all levels, and to provide a safe space for everyone interested in tech. To find our code of conduct, events, or to learn more, you can check out our website virtualcoffee.io. 

 - We just wrapped up [whatever event], and now we have some great things we're working on: [list events]

- We're really glad to have you all here with us today, and I especially want to thank our speakers for being here. 

- Today's event will be livestreamed, recorded, and posted online. 

- Because lightning talks are an introduction into a topic, and here at Virtual Coffee a good way to ease into speaking or gauge interest for a brownbag topic, we won't be taking questions as part of the event, but I'll be tagging the speaker and their topic in the #event-chat channel in slack so please feel free to add questions, comments, or general positivity there.
    - Some of the speakers will be asking questions, so feel free to respond through chat.

I'm very excited about our talks, so now I'm going to introduce our first speaker.
