Hey Friends! 

Thank you so much for all your support. We want to make sure that we're supporting everyone in a timely basis. Below you'll find a timeline as well as some support for you, our amazing mentors.

# Timeline
- Contact speakers between - Feb. 1-3 (about a month before the event)

## What to ask in your message

- Does the speaker knows what type of mentorship they want.
- What date in the next week or two speaker would like to meet
- What is the best way to communicate or meet up

## Suggestions for speakers by mentors
- Brainstorm session, async or sync can work
- Slide review
- Walk through of ideas
- Practice talk
- Live walkthrough using slides (sometimes having to do slides and talk can get tricky)

# TIPS
- Support each speaker where they are.
- Giving a talk can be scary for the most experienced speaker, don't forget to ask how they're doing and to be their cheerleader.
- You have support too! Reach out to other mentors in the #lightning-talk-mentor channel or to anyone on the lightning-talk team.
- Life happens and sometimes we need to back out of volunteer opportunities. That's ok. Just let your coordinator know ASAP, and don't feel obligated to give a reason.
- Please don't speak negatively about the speakers or anyone on the team. If you're having an issue, speak with one of the lightning-talk team leaders.
- A mentor can provide a gentle reminder that you're available.
- Ask if they have a specific topic/area they want to discuss or work on, but be prepared with 1-2 items if they're not sure.
- Spend a little time rapport building, trust takes time (my suggestion is to display a little vulnerability, describing a mistake that you learned from as an example)
- Set clear boundaries when it comes to your time right up front (1 mtg per week 30 minutes, for example)
## Specific to the presentation topic:
- Physical note cards for attempting to organize topics are useful
- If synchronizing schedules is difficult, have them record a presentation for you to review at your pace
