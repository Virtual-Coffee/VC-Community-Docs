Heyyyy <username>!!

There are four (!!!!) more days until VC Lightning Talks and we usually do a technical check-up with the speakers a few days before the event. I know we are spending a lot of time on Zoom and everything is usually working, but we would like like to check-up on a few things just to be sure everyone will see/hear you clearly on Friday! If you have 10-15 minutes this week, please schedule the check-up so we can go through all the technical aspects together.

The times available are in the same timeframe as the event so we can check how your lighting will look at that moment of the day. But if none of them works for you, we can totally find another time, I am super flexible this week :D

Thanks once again for being super awesome to talk on Friday! Looking forward ✨✨
