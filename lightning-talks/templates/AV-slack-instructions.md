AV CHECK-INS
The week of Lightning talks we ask that you do a technical check-in. Ask the speakers you've been assigned to use the computer, microphone, and slides they plan on using the day of the talk. 

Have them meet you in zoom with their camera on and share their screen and quickly run through the slides. Make sure you can hear them well, that you can see their full face on the screen, and that they're able to share their screen.
