@channel Hey, hey, speakers! It's almost time. A couple of things before we start tomorrow:

1. If you have slides, please add a backup copy to this google drive folder.
   Please be present in this channel at least 15 minutes before your talks. Times are scheduled, but things happen. Someone might end early or not be able to attend and coordinators need to be able to ask you to enter the zoom sooner.
2. If you're watching the livestream on YouTube before you go, there is a delay. So you'll have to enter the zoom room before the speaker before you has ended their talk.
3. If you are watching YouTube, please mute it or close it during your talk so we don't hear a delayed echo.
4. If you need help, support, or someone to pep you up, please reach out in this channel or any other VC channel. But we all know you're going to do a great job.
