## Tips for a Successful Talk
* Take time to Listen to These Tips - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVumgiMJeag
* Prepare & Organize - Do yourself a huge favor and plan out your talk! Peer review can help you to distill your thoughts down to the core of what you want to share
* Slides are Optional - Many speakers choose to use slides, but it is not required. If you use slides, remember that they are visual aides, not a teleprompter. Resist the urge to include more than 2-3 brief bullet points per slide
* Practice Out Loud - Give your talk, start to finish, to your rubber ducky, your family, your sink full of dishes, then reflect, revise, and give it again.
* Time your Talk - Lightning talks should be last from 5-15 minutes and cover a single topic
* Slow Down & Remember your Audience - Everyone watching knows you are amazing and can't wait to see your lightning talk. Take a breath, slow down, and speak to us, your friends at Virtual Coffee.

## Thank you again for stepping forward to speak at our February Lightning Talks event!
