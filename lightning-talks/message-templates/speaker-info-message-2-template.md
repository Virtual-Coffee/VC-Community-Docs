- Headshot
- Speaker bio
- Optional links:
  - Social media (Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, etc.)
  - LinkedIn

You can send this info via Slack or email at {{ email address }}. Additionally, I will follow up in a few days to ask for the following:

- Length of talk (in minutes)
- Video recording of talk (if you are not presenting live)
- Talk slides (You can send updated slides directly to @Meg after this date if necessary)

However, you can send this info to me as well if you have it ready now. As always, please let me or @Meg know if you have any questions or comments.
