For the last week of the challenge, a little introspection can be useful.

These are the questions the members can ask themselves:
- Were your goals chosen wisely?
- What habits did you build?
- Did it improve something after 30 days?
-- If not, what would you change?
-- If yes, will you keep it?
- What did you learn about yourself with this challenge?

In the end, it can help members knowing what they need when we talk self-care and healthy habits.


This part of the challenge should be announced in advance to give time to think about it, and may be easier to share in a Zoom meeting rather than on Slack.
