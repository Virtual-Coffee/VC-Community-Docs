## Theme

Healthy Habits for Healthy Devs

## Facilitator

## Description

We're approaching summer and the exciting Hacktoberfest, let's take this month to recharge and recover.
This month challenge is all about nourish our body, mind and spirit and give a step forward to become a healthier dev.

## Goals

Build a new habit that will make you a healthier dev, this can be mind and body centered (drink, move, read, meditate, rearrange your work station) or code centered (review your ReadMe, clean your code, refresh your GitHub repo) or both.


## How it works

- Set your intentions - define and set a new habit you want to build

- Start your habit and track your progress. There are several tools that will help you track your habits: spreadsheets, habit tracker apps or a habit journal. Pick the one that will work best for you.

- Share your progress and celebrate every step. The Goal here is to take baby steps. And remember that building a healthy is a process and that missing a day is part of the process.

## FAQ

### Who participates?

Virtual Coffee's goal is to support all developers, no matter where they are in their coding journey. We encourage all members to participate.


### How to share my progress?

Share your progress in the #monthly-challenge channel in Slack. Small progress is still progress,  such as: "Today I did 10m of yoga" or "Today I reviewed the ReadMe in one project". 

While no other platform is imposed, it can be a good idea to also share on social media for more reach, but only if you are comfortable to do so (Twitter using -or not- the hashtag #VCMonthlyChallenge, a personal blog, a post on [DEV.to](https://dev.to/), you get the idea).


### Some tips for form healthy habits

- Start small and make it easy so it's hard to say no. For example want to increase your water intake, start with a glass of water every morning.
- Make it a schedule, block a time in your calendar to practice your habit
- Track your habits, visualize your progress is great way to motivate yourself
- Show compassion to yourself, remember this is a process and there will some steps back
- Celebrate and reward your wins.
