# Monthly Challenge Facilitators Handbook

Thank you for volunteering to facilitate our monthly challenges!

Most of our challenges have been created, and the directions and structure are available in the monthly challenge folders and on the website. The Monthly Challenge Team Leads and Community Maintainers are always here to answer your questions and support you, so reach out anytime!

To learn more about the in-and-out of our monthly challenge, head over to the [Facilitating a Challenge](facilitate-a-challenge.md) page for general procedures to facilitate a challenge and [Technical Guidelines](technical-guidelines.md) for the technical procedures around Slack and updating monthly challenge pages on the website.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The Monthly Challenge Team abides by the Virtual Coffee [Code of Conduct](https://virtualcoffee.io/code-of-conduct/). Please take a moment to read it.
