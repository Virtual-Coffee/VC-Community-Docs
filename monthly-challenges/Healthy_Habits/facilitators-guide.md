# Healthy Habits for Happy Devs

This is all about nourishing our bodies, minds, and spirits so that we can become healthier developers.

The goal of this challenge is to build a new habit that will make you a healthier dev; this can be mind and body-centered (drink, move, read, meditate, rearrange your workstation) or code-centered (review your README, clean your code, refresh your GitHub repo) or both. Set the goal for yourself this month and define what successfully completing the challenge looks like. For example, it could be reviewing the README in 5 of your projects (one every week) or running 2k twice a week.

## Facilitators Guide

- There is no dedicated person in charge of a task. So, whoever is available to do a task is welcome. Let us know your availability for the challenge in the reminder thread that drops every mid-month in the `#vc-monthly-challenge-team` channel in Slack.ðŸ˜Š
- Async script templates are provided here. We can always modify the scripts based on needs. So, let's record the script when there are changes for our reference.
