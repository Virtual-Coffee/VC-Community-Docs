# Virtual Coffee: Hacktoberfest Initiative

This challenge is always run during October and was our first-ever monthly challenge. We have three tracks: maintainers will provide issues labeled for Hacktoberfest, contributors will solve issues, and mentors will help contributors and maintainers be successful.

> Read our [Monthly Challenge Facilitators Handbook](../facilitators-docs/README.md) to learn how to handle tasks before and after challenges, as well as the technical guidelines.

## Special Tasks

This task is typically handled by our Technology Support Maintainer, Dan Ott.
