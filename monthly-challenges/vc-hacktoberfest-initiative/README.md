# Virtual Coffee: Hacktoberfest Initiative

This challenge is always run during October and was our first-ever monthly challenge. We have three tracks: maintainers will provide issues labeled for Hacktoberfest, contributors will solve issues, and mentors will help contributors and maintainers be successful.

  📢 Please note that this repo is **not** participating in Hacktoberfest and we only accept PRs from our existing members.

  If you want to practice open source or are a maintainer and want to list your repo(s) in our recommended repos for Hacktoberfest, you can still do so until Oct 31!
