## Demo Day Goals

- Members get the opportunity to receive support, encouragement, praise, and feedback for their projects
- They get the chance to have their efforts recorded for later sharing/hype
- Members have a chance to learn from the efforts of others.

### What does demo day look like?

The zoom will be open for a set time with a clear schedule of demos.

#### MC

### What does success look like overall?

- The volunteer team does not feel harried, stressed, or burned out putting this event together.
- The demo-ers feel validated for their efforts in preparing.
- The observers feel motivated, inspired, and impressed by the demos.
- We have a minimum amount of confusion over roles and goals during execution of the event.
- The demo-ers have as little confusion about the structure of the day as possible.

## What do we need to make those goals happen?

- As soon as possible, we need to give members the ability to submit to demo day. (A form). We should know everyone who plans to present, and how they plan to present (live on the day or loom).
- We need to decide on the following roles
  - [ ] Main MC for the event
  - [ ] Main volunteer coordinator for the event
  - [ ] Volunteers for supporting participant preparation
  - [ ] Check in volunteers.
  - [ ] A method for collecting loom/video submission demo links

### What support do facilitators need?

- [ ] Access to the list of participants and the number of participants to manage times accordingly (by July 24th)
- Time to coordinate between the MC and the Host on the day.

### What support do participants need?

- [ ] Access to the demo doc and any other resources we have for preparation for the event
- [ ] Check-ins at the start of the final week, the day before, and the day of the event

### What support do volunteers need?

- [ ] Clear lines of communication to know who's doing what and who to ask for help
- [ ] A simple rubric for the check ins.

### When and how do we communicate event details

- [ ] Form for participants should be ready by Tuesday 20th, July 2021.
- [x] Inform the Coffee team to do explicit calls for form fill out on coffees during the week of 19th to 23rd
