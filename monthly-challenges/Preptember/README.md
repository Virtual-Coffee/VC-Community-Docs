# Preptember

Preptember is the month for open source maintainers and contributors preparing themselves for Hacktoberfest.

For this challenge, we have two tracks. Maintainers will review their open-source repos with our repository checklist to ensure their projects are ready for Hacktoberfest contributions. Contributors will look at their favorite repos, evaluate them based on the guide, and write good issues to fulfill the criteria.

And since September 2023, we provide a [VC Preptember repository](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/vc-preptember) for our members to practice open source and to list repositories that we can verified for Hacktoberfest based on our [Repository Checklist](https://virtualcoffee.io/resources/developer-resources/open-source/maintainer-guide#repository-checklist).
