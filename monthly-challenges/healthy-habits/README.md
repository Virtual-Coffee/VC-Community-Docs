# Healthy Habits for Happy Devs

This challenge is about nourishing our bodies, minds, and spirits to become healthier developers.

The goal is to build a new habit that will make you a healthier developer. This can be mind- and body-centered (drink, move, read, meditate, rearrange your workstation), code-centered (review your README, clean your code, refresh your GitHub repo), or both. Set your goal this month and define what successfully completing the challenge looks like—for example, reviewing the README in five of your projects (one every week) or running 2k twice a week.

> [!TIP]
> Read our [`facilitator-docs.md`](../facilitators-docs.md) to learn how to handle tasks before and after challenges, as well as the technical guidelines.
