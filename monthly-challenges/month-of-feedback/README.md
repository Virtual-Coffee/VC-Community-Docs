# Month of Feedback

This challenge calls members to approach each other with kindness and honesty, and allow this kind of feedback to be a regular part of our process. We offer empathetic responses that are honest and allow them to grow and to fix a problem.

> [!TIP]
> Read our [Monthly Challenge Facilitators Handbook](../facilitators-docs/README.md) to learn how to handle tasks before and after challenges, as well as the technical guidelines.
