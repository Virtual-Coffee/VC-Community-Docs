## Monthly Challenge Leader docs

_Thanks for taking time this month to volunteer to facilitate this month's challenge! The Community Maintainers are always here to answer your questions and to support you, so please reach out at any point! The Challenge has been created, and the directions and structure will be available to you on the monthly challenge page._

### Facilitating the Challenge

#### Before the Challenge

- If you know members who would be interested or good at channel-level mentorship, reach out and ask them
- If anyone agrees to mentor or support the members, add them to the #monthly-challenge-team channel for team communication

#### The First of the Month

- Change the channel topic and description in slack
- Give a brief description of the challenge
- Ask a question or create a call to action to start engagement (ie, How many of you are starting with a blank slate? or Find a job post for your resume and drop the link in this thread!)

#### Throughout the month

- Do a once a week channel check-in.
- Ask members if they have any questions.
- Be the hype-person.
- Check-in with the mentors.
- Drop any links to resources that could help and/or encourage members to do the same.
- Ask the members how they'd like to collect their finished products at the end of the month (slack, posted to the site, other)

#### Tips

- Share. Sometimes it takes seeing the team lead sharing to make other people comfortable.
- Ask questions.

#### Post month

- Provide feedback <3 In the monthly-challenge-team channel, let us know what went well and what could've gone better.
