Thanks for volunteering to facilitate our monthly challenges! The Monthly Challenge Team Leads and Community Maintainers are always here to answer your questions and support you, so please reach out anytime!

## Technical Guidelines

Monthly Challenge team communication and facilitation mostly takes place in Slack and GitHub. In this section, you will find a guide on how to work with Slack and GitHub for the monthly challenge.

Read the "[Facilitating a Challenge](#facilitating-a-challenge)" section to learn more about facilitating a challenge.

### Slack Bot

You can set up the Slack bot to drop a reminder and schedule a thread from your personal account.

#### Slack Reminder

Some challenges require regular reminders during the challenge that drops daily or weekly. You can read the guide on how to set a reminder on the official [Slack help center](https://slack.com/help/articles/208423427-Set-a-reminder).

#### Schedule a Thread

Sometimes, you want to write a customized thread directly from your account, such as weekly check-ins. If you need to post this in a particular hour, you can schedule your message by following the below instructions on your desktop:

1. Go to the channel where you want to post your message.
2. Write your message.
3. Click the down arrow next to the green "Send" icon.

5. Set the day and time. This day and time default to your timezone.
