  Hi friends!
  We're looking for suggestions and support on the monthly challenge team, especially next month.

  If you're up for supporting next month's challenge, please let us know, and we'll add you.

  Here's what we're specifically working on right now:
  1. Do we want to use the [challenge name] challenge again?
  2. Is there anything you want to see differently? What updates should we make for this challenge?
  3. Does anyone want to write a blog post for Virtual Coffee on Dev for this month's challenge?
  ```

- If anyone agrees to mentor or support a monthly challenge, add them to the `#vc-monthly-challenge-team` channel for team communication.

#### Update the Challenge Page on the Website

‚è≥ **Timeline**: Anytime before the challenge starts.

‚úÖ **Tasks**:

- Change and adjust the challenge page on the website to the current challenge and create a PR.

#### Blog Post

‚úÖ **Tasks**:

A blog post is optional. However, introducing and promoting our challenges to the public and our members through blog posts is one of the good ways to engage folks to do the challenge with us.

### Throughout the Challenge

Please read the `facilitators-guide.md` file in each challenge folder for the tasks throughout the challenge.

### Post Month

- Provide feedback in the `#vc-monthly-challenge-team` channel, like what went well and what could've gone better for the challenge. Let us know the support you need and things you think would be nice to do next time.
- Update the `facilitators-guide.md` with the new async script templates and new things the team has done during the month.
