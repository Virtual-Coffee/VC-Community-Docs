# Creating Audio/Visual Content

For this challenge, members present their knowledge and showcase their understanding by exploring video and audio mediums for sharing knowledge, highlighting their achievements. They might do that by giving Lunch & Learns, YouTube videos, podcasts, or some other form of audio or video content they created that explores a coding-related concept — there's no length requirement.

We believe this provides value by solidifying ideas, creating a resource for others, inviting personal growth through conversations sparked by sharing, and demonstrating their ability to talk through a concept.
