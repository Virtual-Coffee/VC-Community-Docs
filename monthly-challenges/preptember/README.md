# Preptember

Preptember is the month open source maintainers and contributors prepare themselves for Hacktoberfest.

For this challenge, we have two tracks. Maintainers will review their open-source repos with our repository checklist to ensure their projects are ready for Hacktoberfest contributions. Contributors will look at their favorite repos, evaluate them based on the guide, and write good issues to fulfill the criteria.

Since September 2023, we have provided a [VC Preptember repository](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/vc-preptember) for our members to practice open source and to list repositories that we can verify for Hacktoberfest based on our [Repository Checklist](https://virtualcoffee.io/resources/developer-resources/open-source/maintainer-guide#repository-checklist).

> [!TIP]
> Read our [`facilitator-docs.md`](../facilitators-docs.md) to learn how to handle tasks before and after challenges, as well as the technical guidelines.
