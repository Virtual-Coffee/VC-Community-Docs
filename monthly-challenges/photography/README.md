# Photography Challenge

This month, we are encouraging our members to take some time away from their screens and get out of the house, then come back and share photographs in Slack. You can, of course, complete the challenge without going more than five feet from your car, but we encourage you to get the benefit of some fresh air and exercise.

> [!TIP]
> Read our [`facilitator-docs.md`](../facilitators-docs.md) to learn how to handle tasks before and after challenges, as well as the technical guidelines.

  Hi friends! There are four steps to participate in this month's challenge:

  Plan: Choose some places to visit outside your home.

  Go: Visit them, and while you‚Äôre there, take photographs of your surroundings. Include a selfie if you want, but the main idea is to photograph the places you visit.

  Post: When you get back, post your photographs in this channel. Or you can post them on your phone while you‚Äôre out if you‚Äôre too impatient to wait!

  Browse: Admire everyone else‚Äôs photographs.
