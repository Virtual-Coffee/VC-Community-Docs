# Photography Challenge

This month, we are encouraging our members to take some time away from their screens and get out of the house, then come back and share photographs in Slack. You can, of course, complete the challenge without going more than five feet from your car, but we encourage you to get the benefit of some fresh air and exercise.

> [!TIP]
> Read our [Monthly Challenge Facilitators Handbook](../facilitators-docs/README.md) to learn how to handle tasks before and after challenges, as well as the technical guidelines.

### Kick-Off Announcement 2024

```text
It‚Äôs now August and that means it is time for a new Monthly Challenge: The Photography Challenge!

This month, we are encouraging our members to take some time away from their screens and get out of the house, then come back and share photographs in Slack.

The challenge will take place in #monthly-challenge. So let's fill the channel with photos this month!

Read our blogpost to learn more. The Challenge page will be up shortly!

### Challenge Intro 2024

```text
  Hi friends! There are four steps to participate in this month's challenge:

  Plan: Choose some places to visit outside your home.

  Go: Visit them, and while you‚Äôre there, take photographs of your surroundings. Include a selfie if you want, but the main idea is to photograph the places you visit.

  Post: When you get back, post your photographs in this channel. Or you can post them on your phone while you‚Äôre out if you‚Äôre too impatient to wait!

  Browse: Admire everyone else‚Äôs photographs.
```
