# Build in Public

## Month

- July 2023
- July 2022
- July 2021
- June 2021

## Description

In this challenge, we're working on creating a habit of talking about the things we're working on, a plan for continuing progress, and creating a demo for the Virtual Coffee community.

## Goals

The idea is to learn to communicate around a project, show the development process, give confidence, and learn to be proud of any progress made.

## Team Preparation and Tasks

---

- There is no dedicated person in charge of a task. So, whoever is available to do a task is welcome. Let us know your availability in the reminder thread that drops every mid-month in the `#vc-monthly-challenge-team` channel in Slack.ðŸ˜Š
- Async script templates are provided here. We can always modify the scripts based on needs. So, let's record the script when there are changes for our reference.

### Before the Challenge

#### Ask for Members' Opinions and Help

**Time**: Two weeks before the challenge starts.

When we need more support, ask these questions in the `#announcement` channel in Slack:

- Do we want to do the same challenge as last year for the next challenge?
- Does anyone want to help write a blog post for the next challenge?
- What do folks want to see differently in the challenge? Are there updates we should make for the challenge?

> 1. Do we want to use the [challenge name] challenge again?

3. What updates should we make?

#### Blog Post

**Time**: On the 1st day of the challenge.

Itâ€™s usually a short 5-10 minute demo, and your project doesnâ€™t have to be complete. We can put them up on YT if youâ€™re comfortable with that, but we donâ€™t need to. <br>
