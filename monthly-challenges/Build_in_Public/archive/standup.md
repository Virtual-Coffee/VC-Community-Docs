For June, the monthly challenge is to build in public. As part of this we would like to use Standup to keep each other informed on our progress.

## What is Stand up?

A series of daily questions to give a quick update on your current progress. Usually held a start of the day so all team members can get a quick update on where everyone is. There is usually a set time limit and only one person talks at a time. This is often controlled by having an object like a book. Only the person holding the object is allowed to speak when they are done they pass the object around.

### Questions

#### What did you do yesterday?

What did you accomplish yesterday(since the last update)?

#### What are you doing today?

- What do you plan to do today. Any particular goals you want to met before the end of day.

#### Do you have any blockers?

A blocker is something keeping you from your goal. A problem you need some help to resolve. Anything team mates can help with. Team members can give you some quick tips. For more involved answers you can set up a one on one discussion outside of the stand up.

## Virtual Coffee Standup Script

"Hello everyone,
Thanks for coming to today's Month of Learn in Public standup session. The way standup works is we each spend about one minute answering the following questions:

- What did you do yesterday?
- What we worked on since our last stand up session?
- What we plan on working on next?

You can mention any roadblocks or stumbling blocks we're looking for help with. If you haven't worked on any more since your last standup it's fine to say, "no updates, still planning on tackling {next steps} soon."

If anyone wants to discuss people's roadblocks/pairing afterwards, feel free to reach out to each other after the standup, either in the #monthly-challenge channel or #help-and-pairing

Please remember to try and keep your reports brief. There should be no need to rush but we try to be respectful of everyone's time here.
I'll start..."
