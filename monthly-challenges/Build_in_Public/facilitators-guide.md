# Build in Public

In this challenge, we're working on creating a habit of talking about the things we're working on, a plan for continuing progress, and creating a demo for the Virtual Coffee community.

Build in Public challenge aims to learn to communicate around a project, show the development process, give confidence, and be proud of any progress made.

## Facilitators Guide

- There is no dedicated person in charge of a task. So, whoever is available to do a task is welcome. Let us know your availability for the challenge in the reminder thread that drops every mid-month in the `#vc-monthly-challenge-team` channel in Slack.ðŸ˜Š
- Async script templates are provided here. We can always modify the scripts based on needs. So, let's record the script when there are changes for our reference.
