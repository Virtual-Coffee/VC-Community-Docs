# Build in Public

In this challenge, we're working on creating a habit of talking about the things we're working on, a plan for continuing progress, and creating a demo for the Virtual Coffee community.

We aim to learn to communicate around a project, show the development process, give confidence, and be proud of any progress made.

> Read our [`facilitator-docs.md`](../facilitators-docs.md) to learn how to handle tasks before and past challenges and the technical guidelines.

  Hey friends!
  
  In the past, we‚Äôve done a demo day on the last Friday of the month. If you‚Äôre interested, respond with a ‚úã.

  It's usually a short 5 to 10-minute demo, and your project doesn‚Äôt have to be complete.

  If you're comfortable, we can put the demo up on YouTube, but we don‚Äôt need to. If you'd rather do some feedback session, we can work on that too.
