# Build in Public

In this challenge, we're working on creating a habit of talking about the things we're working on, a plan for continuing progress, and creating a demo for the Virtual Coffee community.

We aim to learn to communicate around a project, show the development process, give confidence, and be proud of any progress made.

> [!TIP]
> Read our [Monthly Challenge Facilitators Handbook](../facilitators-docs/README.md) to learn how to handle tasks before and after challenges, as well as the technical guidelines.

**Note:** In 2021, we dedicated June to the Build in Public challenge and July to Demo Day. Since July 2022, we have combined them into one challenge.

### Async Check-Ins 2023

```text
Hi friends, it's time for the daily check-in!
Share your progress with us! ðŸ™Œ

- What did you do yesterday?
- What are you doing today?
- Do you have any blockers?
```

### Demo Day 2023

```text
  Hey friends!

  In the past, weâ€™ve done a demo day on the last Friday of the month. If youâ€™re interested, respond with a âœ‹.

  It's usually a short 5 to 10-minute demo, and your project doesnâ€™t have to be complete.

  If you're comfortable, we can put the demo up on YouTube, but we donâ€™t need to. If you'd rather do some feedback session, we can work on that too.
  ```
