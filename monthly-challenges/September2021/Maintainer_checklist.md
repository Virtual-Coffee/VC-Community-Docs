# What is this document for?

This document is a short and simple guide to determining if a repository on github is a good fit for someone looking to contribute to open source.

This is far from an exhaustive resource, and truly, we'd rather not bombard you with a massive tome of items and conditions.

Rather, this will highlight some key areas we feel are beneficial, and mention some points to consider and think about.

It also doubles as a guide to the virtual coffee requirements for all our endorsed open source projects.

Ultimately, you as the reader are the final decisionmaker on whether you contribute to a project. This will hopefully just provide a little insight to help that process along.

So in no particular order, here's an _opinionated_ - but not prescriptive - guide for finding good open source projects.

## Name, Description, Tags
We're starting with these because they're the most basic, but also the simplest gut check for a OSS reposity.
- It should have a relvant name.
- It should have a clear description that tells you what the project does and what it's for.
- It should have relevant tags highlighting its scope/stack/field etc.

You may find this trivial, but these are first and most straightforward way github uses to recommend your content to potential contributors.*

*Also, if you're looking to particpate in [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/), adding the `Hacktoberfest` tag to your repo description is one especially important way to indicate that.

## Docs, Docs, Docs,

At the end of the day, all we know of a project before we start it is what we say, and what the maintainer tells us. Having good documentation is the best indicator that a project is well maintained, well supported, and has a healthy and active community. There are a plethora of materials a repo can utilize to provide context to potential contributors, but the docs that matters most are:
 - **The README** - This is the face of your repo. It's the first thing anyone sees, after maybe the name and description, and it's the nexus for all content, links, docs, and other project associations. A project without a README is probably not ready for accepting contributions. Some basic things you should include in your readme are:
    - A more detailed description of the project than the description field in Github
    - How To Install/Run your application or a link to document that explains that
    - A link to the code of conduct
    - Project status, roadmap, and any other pertinent details for those interested in using or contributing to the app
 - **The Code of Conduct** - I do not want to contribute to any project without a code of conduct (usually referred to as the **COC**). It's the bare minimum for ensuring that a maintainer has at least thought about the types of interactions they want to have between all project contributors. There are many code of conduct styles online and many projects use one of the standard templates (which is fine). But it's always worth taking a look at a project's code of conduct before starting any contribution work. No COC is a red flag, and discussions in issues and pull requests that look like they violate the COC is also a red flag.
