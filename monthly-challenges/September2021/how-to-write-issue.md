# How to Write a Good Issue

## What are issues?

Issues are a way to list and keep track all the tasks that need to be done in a GitHub repository.
Whether they identify a bug, or announce a project of feature, issues can be created by anybody. 
Although, they are managed by the repository maintainer (aka the person or group in charge).

2 quick examples:
- I am a maintainer, I know my app needs an update button in the profile page. I will
create an issue to remember it, and it will help me plan my next deployment.
- I am a user, I love the app, and I think it would be even better without this annoying 
bug when I log in. I will create an issue to let the maintainer know about this problem that
they probably don't know about.

Anybody can create issues in a repo, only the maintainers can manage them.

## Important things to know
There is not one good way to write issues. But there are things we want to avoid that
either will discredit what we want / need, or won't help the person who will try to solve the 
issue.

The most important things to remember are:
- an issue needs facts (picture, or metrics, ...). It is easier to explain than just using
words.
- think about describing an issue with What, Where, When, How and Why.
- You are not expected to solve the issue. It happens of course, but someone else can jump on it
and they will need to understand it without being in your head :)

Also, a suggested solution can be a good thing, especially to help the contributors that have less
experience. It is not the most relevant thing to have though since often many other solutions can 
work too.

## How to write an issue?

Like said above, there is not only one way to do it.

The first thing to check is if there is an available template and/or rules for it. You can find this 
information in the ReadMe of the repository.
In repos that are used to get a lot of traffic and issues, there is often an automatic template that 
appears when you create the issue. In that case, follow exactly the steps and requirements.
It is also good to remember that a lot of repos have a now Code of Conduct (CoC) to follow and we 
encourage you to read it. Absence of CoC is regretted but doesn't mean people can have a disrespectful 
behavior, even if the issue is "super frustrating".

If there is no specific rules, here is a list of what's good to share in an issue:
- [ ] A title that is clear enough to identify in few words what the problem is about.
- [ ] Screenshots if the issue is in the UI, logs if it's a performance issue... anything that proves
the existence of the problem.
- [ ] Your setup: type of device and OS version, type of browser and version, any kind of setup
that can help reproducing the problem.
- [ ] Description of how to reproduce the bug / behavior (the buttons you clicked, the request you've 
made, ...)
- [ ] If you think of a solution to solve the problem, you can suggest something. Remember that your 
solution may not be the best solution for that specific issue / techno / repo...
