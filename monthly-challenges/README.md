# Monthly Challenges

Welcome to the Monthly Challenges docs! **Thank you all for supporting Virtual Coffee!**

> [!NOTE]
> A friendly reminder that volunteering for Virtual Coffee should never stress you out. We value your help and support, but we know that can vary from month to month. Just let us know if you need to take some time off from volunteering. We're happy to support you.

These docs are written to support our wonderful volunteers.

## What are Monthly Challenges?

Every month, we create a challenge for our Virtual Coffee members to complete together.

These monthly challenges allow members to learn, grow, and receive support and mentorship. Each month's challenge will have a theme and weekly goals for the members to work on. Instructions, resources, and additional help for the challenges are provided in the `#monthly-challenge` channel in Slack. Our Monthly Challenge Team Leads and our Maintainers plan, organize, and facilitate these challenges.

We have developers at all stages and in many different roles, so we want to ensure any member can participate in these challenges.

## Monthly Challenges Guidelines

The [Monthly Challenge Facilitators Handbook](./facilitators-docs.md) provides a guide for facilitating monthly challenges.

Every challenge has different things to prepare and execute. Please read the README file in each challenge's folder to see how to conduct it.

Our monthly challenges plan for the year is available in Google Docs and is pinned in the `#vc-monthly-challenge-team` channel on Slack. If you have ideas about a theme we can do as a community, please let our Monthly Challenges Team Leads know for consideration.
