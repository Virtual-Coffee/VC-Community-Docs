# Monthly-Challenge & Monthly Themes

Welcome to the Monthly Challenge and Theme docs! **Thank you all for supporting Virtual Coffee!**

> :triangular_flag_on_post: Hey - Just a friendly reminder that volunteering for Virtual Coffee should never be something that stresses you out. We value your help and support, but we know that can vary from month to month. If you need to take some time off from volunteering, just let us know. We're happy to support you.

These docs are to written with the intention of supporting our wonderful volunteers.

## Monthly Theme

The goal with the theme is something we can focus on as a whole community. There's no goal or achievement, but it's something we might talk about more during coffee chats and in slack.

## Monthly Challenge

This should build off of the monthly theme, but have a goal to work towards. These can either be community goals, like the [November Challenge for blogging](https://virtualcoffee.io/monthlychallenges/nov-2020/) or individual goals like the [December challenge for month of pairing](https://virtualcoffee.io/monthlychallenges/dec-2020/).

We have developers at all stages and in many different roles, so we want to make sure that anyone can participate in these challenges.

## Monthly Needs

We need volunteers in the following roles:

### Next month's prep

- Ask community for what they want from this challenge :question:
- Update facilitator docs on VC-Contributors to document the support we'll need, resources, any feedback :hand:
- Add the new challenge to our VCIO site :computer:

### Current month's facilitation

- Synchronous check-ins lead (makes announcement about when and where and leads the check-in)
- Async check-ins/channel hype person :boom:
  - Do either a Monday goal setting post or a Wednesday check-in or both.
  - Make a mid-month announcement in the monthly challenge channel about whatâ€™s happening next month.
