# Creative Community Challenge

Devs are more than just the code we write. This challenge is all about embracing self-expression. Give back to yourself by indulging in something just for fun. Share the art, music, poetry, sports, games, or other hobbies that spark your joy. We spend so much time grinding away on understanding things in the tech space. Let's make some space for the other parts of ourselves. In this challenge, we encourage folks to spend time working on things that aren't necessarily code-specific or using code to improve other hobbies and outlets.

> [!TIP]
> Read our [`facilitator-docs.md`](../facilitators-docs.md) to learn how to handle tasks before and after challenges, as well as the technical guidelines.
