# Community Kindness

This challenge encourages our members to celebrate one of the things that continually makes this community so special: Kindness.

Some of the ways we see this include: practicing gratitude, reaching out to support other members, mentoring, helping, giving honest and constructive feedback, and continuing to make Virtual Coffee a safe and supportive space.

### Kick-Off Announcement 2024

```text
Itâ€™s now May and that means it is time for a new Monthly Challenge: Community Kindness.

It's amazing to realize that we've made it through more than four years of Virtual Coffee! As we work hard to make sure this community continues to be the special and close-knit group that it has been during that time, let's celebrate one of the things that continually makes this community so special: Kindness.

This monthâ€™s challenge will take place in #monthly-challenge, but you can do kindness anywhere, from DMs to LinkedIn.

The challenge page will be up shortly.

### Async Check-Ins 2024

- **Week 1**

  ```text
  Hi friends! To start us of for the month of Community Kindness we have some ideas on the [Monthly Challenge page](https://virtualcoffee.io/monthlychallenges/may-2024), but feel free to participate in any way you want.

  If you have some great ideas for how to spread kindness around the community, drop them here!
  ```

- **Week 2**

  ```text
  Hi friends, how are y'all getting on with Community Kindness? Feel free to share your good deeds of the week in this thread! ðŸ’–

  @Meg kicked us off with a brilliant challenge last week. And we want to give you a new format each week on how to show community kindness! (These ideas came from Meg so credit and thanks to her!). Of course, if you want to complete the challenge in your own way, that's okay too!

  Last week, Meg challenged y'all to reach out to a new VC member or one you haven't spoken to for a while.

  For the next week we are challenging you to do this again plus do something that is low-to-mid-effort, like share a tip or helpful link or spend some time in #help-and-pairing.
  ```

- **Week 3**

  ```text
  Hi friends! As we continue with our @Meg-inspired format for the month of Community Kindness, this week we challenge you to carry on with the previous week's challenges (reaching out to a new VC member or one you haven't spoken to for a while), and take it to the next level with our week three suggestion: Go to a VC event you haven't attended before / been to for a while! There's lots going on throughout the week, so keep an eye on #announcements and #vc-events!

  Just a reminder, whatever you're doing for this month, you're all awesome! ðŸ’–

  Feel free to drop your good deeds for the week in this thread!
  ```

- **Week 4**

  ```text
  Hi friends! As we move into the final week of the month of Community Kindness, following our @Meg-inspired format, this week we challenge you again to carry on with the challenges from previous week's (reaching out to a new VC member or one you haven't spoken to for a while, sharing a tip or spending some time in #help-and-pairing, and attending a VC event you haven't been to before or for a while), and take it to the final level with our week four suggestion: Shoutout week! Give another VC'er a shoutout. Either internally in the #gratitude channel / Friday gratitude post in #general or in public by giving a shoutout on X or Mastodon or writing them a recommendation on LinkedIn.

  Just a reminder, whatever you're doing for this month, you're all awesome! ðŸ’–

  Feel free to drop your good deeds for the week in this thread!
