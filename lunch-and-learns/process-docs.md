# Process Docs

Below is the entire lifecycle of a Virtual Coffee Lunch & Learn session.

## Roles
There are several moving parts to making a successful Lunch & Learn. These docs are organized as to not assume one person is doing multiple roles (they could but they don't have to). It will also make it easy to assign roles as needed as our volunteer groups expand and contract.

_**NOTE:** One person can take on multiple roles._

### Speaker
That's the person actually giving the talk! To make role as inviting and accessible as possible, we try to have the speaker do as little of the pre and post process as necessary. That way, they can focus of what's important; preparing and delivering their talk! The speaker is also in charge of putting together their bio and relevant information (name of talk, their name forthe purpose of introduction, any other relavant details, links, etc)

### Data Wrangler (DW)
Manages the Lunch & Learn issue by verifying information from the request form and assigning the Moderator. Ensures smooth progression of the event through the project board.

### Logistics Coordinator (LC)
Handles scheduling by checking availability and coordinating with the Speaker, Host, and Moderator. Sends confirmations and calendar invites. Performs check-ins with the Speaker before the event and manages the logistics on the day of the event.

### Marketing
Promotes the Lunch & Learn through the newsletter, Slack, social media, and announcement scripts. Ensures the event is well-publicized. Has to coordinate with other Virtual Coffee marketing and communication norms and schedules

### Moderator
The moderator leads the Lunch & Learn session. They will introduce the speaker and read their bio. Also monitors the chat during the Lunch & Learn session, asks questions for participants, and introduces and concludes the session using the event script. Posts a thank you message to the Speaker after the event. 

### Host
Sets up the Zoom meeting, starts and stops the recording, and allows time for attendees to arrive. Coordinates closely with the Moderator during the session.

### Post-production Team:
Includes Editors and Graphics Coordinator (GC) who handle post-event cleanup of the video file. They will ensure that the video is clipped so as to only include the relevant content (intro, presentation, and outro), check for video quality, and upload to relavant platforms.

## Scheduling a Lunch & Learn

### Lunch & Learn Session Request Is Submitted

- **KICK-OFF ACTION:** The Speaker fills out a Lunch & Learn request form.
- A message of confirmation of submission is automatically sent to the Speaker.
  - It informs the Speaker that their request was received and they should hear a response within 3 business days.

### Lunch & Learn Session Request Is Received

- The LC and DW receive the form submission.

#### Scheduling Workflow

1. The LC checks the calendar for availability in order of the Speaker's preferred dates.

   a. If any of the Speaker's suggested time slots are available, continue to step 2.
   b. If none of the Speaker's suggested time slots are available, the LC reaches out to the Speaker to ask for additional time slot options or to postpone the Lunch & Learn until a later date:

   [LINK NEW TIME SLOTS EMAIL TEMPLATE] <!-- TODO -->

   Go back to Step 1. Iterate until the Speaker submits a time slot that's listed as available on the calendar.

2. The LC confirms availability of a leadership team member to act as the Host.
3. The LC confirms availability of a Moderator.

   a. If one of the Speaker's suggested time slots has been agreed on by both the Host and Moderator, the LC sends a follow-up email to the Speaker:

   [LINK EMAIL FOLLOW-UP TEMPLATE] <!-- TODO -->

   Continue on to step 4.

   b. If none of the Speaker's suggested time slots work for the Host and/or Moderator, the LC reaches out to the Speaker to ask for additional time slot options or to postpone the Lunch & Learn until a later date:

   [LINK NEW TIME SLOTS EMAIL TEMPLATE] <!-- TODO -->

   Go back to Step 1. Iterate these steps until a time slot is agreed upon.

4. The LC adds the Lunch & Learn event to the Virtual Coffee Google calendar and invites the Moderator, the Host, and the Speaker to that event.
5. The Host adds the Lunch & Learn event on [meetingplace.io](https://meetingplace.io/virtual-coffee/events).

### Populating the New Lunch & Learn Issue

Once the Lunch & Learn is confirmed and scheduled, the DW checks the information received via the Lunch & Learn request form against the automatically generated issue and adjusts where necessary. Then, the DW assigns the Moderator to the Lunch & Learn issue. The Moderator is responsible for collecting any missing information, making further issue adjustments, and moving the issue card through the project board.

## Pre-Lunch & Learn Timeline

### Confirmation Through the Day Before the Lunch & Learn

- Marketing adds the Lunch & Learn to the monthly newsletter.
- Marketing schedules announcements about the Lunch & Learn to go out on Slack/social media.
- Marketing adds the Lunch & Learn to the Tuesday/Thursday announcement script.
- The Host sets up recordable Zoom meeting with the preferred display settings (if applicable).
- The LC does a check-in with the Speaker 24â€”72 hours prior to the Lunch & Learn.
- The LC lets the Speaker know that the Moderator will watch the chat and voice any questions that come through.
- The LC requests the Speaker's slides 24 hours prior to the Lunch & Learn (if applicable).

### Day of the Lunch & Learn

- The LC does a second check-in with the Speaker the morning of the Lunch & Learn.
- The LC posts the Zoom link to the event approximately 1 hour before the start time.

## During the Session

_**NOTE:** The Moderator and the Host can be the same person._

- The Moderator and the Speaker arrive 15 minutes prior to the scheduled start time to check equipment and settle in.
- The Host allows 5 minutes for attendees to arrive.
- The Moderator lets the Host know when to start the recording.
- The Moderator kicks off the Lunch & Learn and introduces the Speaker using [the Lunch & Learn event script template](/lunch-and-learns/event-script-template.md#intro).
- The Speaker presents their Lunch & Learn.
- The Moderator observes the chat and asks questions for non-vocal participants.
- Once the Speaker finishes their presentation, the Moderator gives a verbal transition into Q&A (unless the Speaker does it themself).
- The Moderator gives the official sign off using [the Lunch & Learn event script template](/lunch-and-learns/event-script-template.md#outro).
- The Host stops the recording.

## Post-Lunch & Learn

- The Moderator posts a thank you message to the Speaker in Slack's #vc-events channel.
- Marketing posts the same thank you message to Twitter.
- The Post-production Team starts processing the video footage (if applicable) following [the YouTube video procedures doc](/procedures/youtube.md).

## Cancelling a Lunch & Learn

- If a speaker needs to cancel a Lunch & Learn, they should inform the Logistics Coordinator (LC). Together, they will determine if the session will be postponed to a determined date, postponed indefinitely, or cancelled.
  
- The LC should then inform the rest of the L&L team that the planned event is cancelled. That includes the Marketing, Moderator, and Host roles, but really the entire team should be aware, and the L&L issue updated accordingly.

- If the VC team needs to cancel the L&L, the LC should inform the Speaker, and determine if the session will be postponed to a determined date, postponed indefinitely, or cancelled.

- The Marketing role will share on all relevant mediums that the event is no longer taking place. As of right now that would include:
  - Slack
  - The VC events page
  - Twitter/X
  - The newsletter team (if the relevant issue has not yet been published)
