## Scheduling a Lunch & Learn

### Lunch & Learn Session Request Is Submitted

- **KICK-OFF ACTION:** The Speaker fills out a Lunch & Learn request form.
- A message of confirmation of submission is automatically sent to the Speaker.
  - It informs the Speaker that their request was received and they should hear a response within 3 business days.

### Lunch & Learn Session Request Is Received

- The LC and DW receive the form submission.

#### Scheduling Workflow

1. The LC checks the calendar for availability in order of the Speaker's preferred dates.

   a. If any of the Speaker's suggested time slots are available, continue to step 2.
   b. If none of the Speaker's suggested time slots are available, the LC reaches out to the Speaker to ask for additional time slot options or to postpone the Lunch & Learn until a later date:

   [LINK NEW TIME SLOTS EMAIL TEMPLATE] <!-- TODO -->

   Go back to Step 1. Iterate until the Speaker submits a time slot that's listed as available on the calendar.

2. The LC confirms availability of a leadership team member to act as the Host.
3. The LC confirms availability of a Moderator.

   a. If one of the Speaker's suggested time slots has been agreed on by both the Host and Moderator, the LC sends a follow-up email to the Speaker:

   [LINK EMAIL FOLLOW-UP TEMPLATE] <!-- TODO -->

   Continue on to step 4.

   b. If none of the Speaker's suggested time slots work for the Host and/or Moderator, the LC reaches out to the Speaker to ask for additional time slot options or to postpone the Lunch & Learn until a later date:

   [LINK NEW TIME SLOTS EMAIL TEMPLATE] <!-- TODO -->

   Go back to Step 1. Iterate these steps until a time slot is agreed upon.

4. The LC adds the Lunch & Learn event to the Virtual Coffee Google calendar and invites the Moderator, the Host, and the Speaker to that event.
5. The Host adds the Lunch & Learn event on [meetingplace.io](https://meetingplace.io/virtual-coffee/events).

### Populating the New Lunch & Learn Issue

Once the Lunch & Learn is confirmed and scheduled, the DW checks the information received via the Lunch & Learn request form against the automatically generated issue and adjusts where necessary. Then, the DW assigns the Moderator to the Lunch & Learn issue. The Moderator is responsible for collecting any missing information, making further issue adjustments, and moving the issue card through the project board.
