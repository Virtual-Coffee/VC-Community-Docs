Feelings Friday was started at the Flatiron School coding bootcamp by its founders, Avi Flombaum & Adam Enbar, after noticing burnout among their first cohorts. Join a safe space to share what that's on your mind and hold space for others. It's a great way to unwind at the end of the week!

### Frontend Friday Folks Fighting CSSBattle.dev

**When:**

- Every other Friday at 11:00 AM ET

**Lead & Host:**

- Jörn Bernhardt

Every other Friday, we solve a new puzzle at [CSSBattle.dev](https://cssbattle.dev/). We meet in the #co-working-room for this Coffee Table, and can move our meeting to a breakout room so as not to disturb any co-working VC members. Feel free to join us and learn more about CSS! If you can't make it, be sure to play along on your own and post your answers in [Virtual Coffee's CSS Battles Discussion board](https://github.com/orgs/Virtual-Coffee/discussions/categories/css-battles)!
