# Guide to Leading a Coffee Table Group

## Definition

A Coffee Table Group Leader creates a space and context for conversation. Current leaders describe the role as a [Virtual Coffee Room Leader](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/VC-Contributors/tree/main/coffees/RoomLeaders-ConversationFacilitators), but with a content focus. A Leader hosts events on a consistent schedule, comes up with topics to discuss for each event, and encourages attendess. They also set expectations for attendees via clear communication about scheduling and giving new members context when they join.

## Guidelines

- If using the VC-events CMS, have 1-2 group leaders willing to keep the CMS up to date and communicate with the Coffee Table Groups Lead.
- If there are any major changes, like descriptions, frequency, etc. communicate with the Coffee Table Groups Lead to keep the site and documentation up to date.
- Adherence to the [Code of Conduct](https://virtualcoffee.io/code-of-conduct)
- Use the [COC violation form](https://virtualcoffee.io/report-coc-violation/) rather than trying to take care of Code of Conduct violations yourself.
- Clearly relate any guidelines or requirements to members of your group. For example let them know if they must commit to leading a session, have a specific experience level, etc.

## Best practices

Each Coffee Table Group will have its own approach and personality, but it's important to create an environment where your group members feel supported and know what to expect. Here are some tips to help establish a healthy group:

### Group Format

- Determine the schedule, type, and format for your group
- Will you meet weekly, monthly, or some other way?
- Will it always be a synchronous meeting?
- Will you have async check-ins in between meetings?

### Expectations

- What type of meeting is it (Q&amp;A, presentation, small group convo, pair programming, interactive, etc.)?
- Is there material that needs to be covered?
- Will members be asked to lead a session?
- Are other volunteers or co-leads needed?
- Are there expectations for communication among the group members? Where will you be communicating? (slack channel, only in zoom, etc.).
- Are there expectations for communicating in a video chat (for example, using the hand raise function, doing an intro, etc.)?
- Please provide the following links in video meetings:
  - [Code of Conduct](https://virtualcoffee.io/code-of-conduct/)
  - [COC Violation Form](https://virtualcoffee.io/report-coc-violation/)

### Ending a Group

If your group is an ongoing group, you may find that you don't have the time or energy to continue hosting. That's ok. It's really important that all volunteers (and leading a coffee table group is definitely an act of volunteering) know that it is always okay to prioritize their mental and physical health. Rather than discontinuing the group by not scheduling a new one, see if anyone in the group or the larger VC community is willing to take on the responsibility. Communicate with your Coffee Table Group about the need for a new host. If you're unable to do so, let the Coffee Table Groups Lead know.
