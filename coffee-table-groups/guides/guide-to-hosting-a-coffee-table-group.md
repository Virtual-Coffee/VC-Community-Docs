# Guide to Hosting a Coffee Table Group

## Zoom Logistics

One of the many benefits of starting a Coffee Table group is that Virtual Coffee provides you with a Zoom room in which to host the event. As long as the Coffee Table group information is kept up to date (see [Coffee Table Groups](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/VC-Contributors/blob/6d722dceba508ecf8f583dedb3df3b1fb9fbde42/coffee-table-groups/coffee-table-groups.md) for the most up-to-date listings), your Zoom room should automatically start at the appropriate time and be accessible to all group Hosts and Leaders.

As a Coffee Table Group Host, you should have access to two private Slack channels: `#vc-events-admin` and `#vc-active-volunteers`. If you aren't in both of these channels, please contact the [Coffee Table Group Coordinator](#coffee-table-group-coordinator).

Your specific Coffee Table group may have their own Slack channel as well as additional Host instructions. If so, be sure to join the channel and read their guide!

### Starting a Meeting

You may enter the Zoom up to 10 minutes before the start of the event. Do so by navigating to the `#vc-events` or `#vc-events-admin` channel in Slack and clicking the 'Join Event' button on the 'Starting soon' event post.

If you'd like to make a your own post to let people know that your Coffee Table group is starting soon, do this now. You can create a thread on the 'Starting soon' post in the `#vc-events` channel or create an entirely separate post. Boost your event in other relevant Slack channels as well for a broader reach.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not post in the `#vc-announcements` channel. This channel is reserved for automated daily event posts and other announcements relevant to the Virtual Coffee community.

#### Claiming Host and Assigning Co-host

When you arrive in the Zoom, enter the Host Code to claim Host privledges. To do this, navigate to the `#vc-events-admin` channel in Slack and copy the Host Code from the posted Coffee Table group event. Back in Zoom, open the Participants tab and click on the 'Claim host' button to input the code.

Once your Co-host enters the Zoom, hover over their name in the Participants tab and click the 'More ▿' button. Select the 'Make co-host' option to grant them Co-host privledges.

> [!WARNING]
> As Zoom Host, if you leave the Zoom, you will end the call for all participants! If you have to leave early, be sure to pass hHost privledges to your Co-host by following the steps above and selecting 'Make host' before exiting the Zoom call.

#### Creating Breakout Rooms

Some Coffee Table groups utilize breakout rooms. If yours is one of those groups, read on to learn how to create breakout rooms.

Once you claim Host in Zoom, you'll see a 'Breakout rooms' tab. When you select this, a pop-up will appear with options. Be sure to select the following:

- Allow participants to choose room
- Allow participants to return to the main session at any time

Then, select the number of breakout rooms you want to create.

Don't forget to click on 'Open all rooms' when you're finished creating them!

### Ending a Meeting

Once your Coffee Table event has finished, click the 'End' button. This will trigger a pop-up where you'll select 'End meeting for all.'

> [!CAUTION]
> Normally, it's okay if your Coffee Table meeting runs past your scheduled time – just make sure there isn't another VC event directly following yours. If that's the case, you can always ask the group to move to the `#co-working-room` to free up the Zoom for the next event.
