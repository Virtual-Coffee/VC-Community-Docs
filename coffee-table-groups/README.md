# Coffee Table Groups

Our Coffee Table Groups have been one of the most popular and valuable features for members of our community. Coffee Table Groups are small, special interest groups created and run by members. They can involve Zoom meetings, async Slack hangouts, or anything else that the members would like to do.

## Definition

A group with a common interest who would like to cultivate it through more intimate and scheduled conversation. Member-led, developed, and driven for other VC members. Coffee Table Groups adhere to the [Virtual Coffee Code of Conduct](https://virtualcoffee.io/code-of-conduct) and hold community feedback in the highest regard. The result is a meetup with a smaller group that will implement suggestions. Because these groups are part of the VC community, there may be industry veterans in attendance, willing to engage and connect, or the leader may encourage attendees to speak with specific VC members per topic of conversation.

## Benefits

- Zoom rooms hosted by Virtual Coffee
- Events appear in announcements and on the [Virtual Coffee events page](https://virtualcoffee.io/events)
